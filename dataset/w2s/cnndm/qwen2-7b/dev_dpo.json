Now, the cruel disease that has gripped several generations of Chris Graham's family has struck again. Mr Graham himself was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease at just 34. The ex-serviceman, now 39, discovered in 2010 that he carries the same faulty gene that claimed the lives of his father, aunt, cousin and granddad, all in their 40s. This rare, inherited, or 'familial' form of Alzheimer's disease has also left his 43-year-old brother, Tony, bedbound in a care home and being fed through a tube. Scroll down for video . Chris Graham was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease at just 34. Several members of his family have been killed by the cruel, genetic form of the condition . Like his brother, Mr Graham carries a faulty version of PSEN-1 gene, which affects around 400 families worldwide. The father-of-three, from Carterton in Oxfordshire, is experiencing mild memory problems, but knows it is a case of when, not if, his dementia progresses. Although he is young, the disease process will affect him in the same way as the estimated 500,000 people with Alzheimer's in the UK. Mr Graham, who was medically discharged from the Army in January after 23 years' service, said: 'My friends didn't believe me when I told them I had Alzheimer's disease. 'At the age of 39, it just doesn't make sense to people: I'm fighting fit – how can I have something like that? We still think of Alzheimer's as a bit of forgetfulness as we get older. The truth is far worse.' He continued: 'My family has been hit hard by Alzheimer's. Dad died aged 42. He was in hospital so long I don't really remember him, I was only six or seven at the time. 'His sister, my aunt Thelma, died at 41 as she inherited the faulty gene too. I also lost a cousin, Thelma's daughter, at 41, and a granddad, Dad's father, at 46 to the disease.' This rare, inherited, or 'familial' form of Alzheimer's disease has also left his 43-year-old brother, Tony (pictured with his son), bedbound in a care home and being fed through a tube . The disease also claimed the life of Mr Graham's father. He said: 'My family has been hit hard by Alzheimer's. Dad died aged 42. He was in hospital so long I don't really remember him, I was only six or seven at the time' As one of four children, each of Mr Graham and his siblings had a 50/50 chance of inheriting the gene from their father. While his two sisters avoided the genetic curse, tragically, both he and his brother Tony have been struck by it. Speaking about his brother, who was diagnosed in 2006, said: 'He's in an old folk's home, he can't move and has to be fed through a tube. He can't speak but can raise a smile sometimes.' Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and is responsible for killing brain cells and shrinking the brain 400 per cent faster than the normal rate of ageing. Mr Graham is now taking part in research studies at University College London's Institute of Neurology to help scientists understand the earliest signs of Alzheimer's to boost the search for new treatments. He said: 'Although I know what will happen to me in the coming years, I now have direction in life. 'I wanted to do something to fight back against the disease – to do as much as I can while I can. It's simple for me, you have to hit the enemy directly, so I've taken on a challenge to help support research and I'm taking part in studies.' Now, to raise awareness of dementia and vital funds for Alzheimer's Research UK, Mr Graham is heading off on a 16,000 mile cycle ride around Canada and America in April. His year-long challenge has earned the support of Prime Minister David Cameron, who praised Mr Graham's 'extraordinary grit and determination' to raise money for the charity. Mr Graham said of his brother (pictured right with his own children): 'He's in an old folk's home, he can't move and has to be fed through a tube. He can't speak but can raise a smile sometimes'. Tony is pictured with his partner Jane . Now, to raise awareness of dementia and vital funds for Alzheimer's Research UK, Mr Graham is heading off on a 16,000 mile cycle ride around Canada and America in April . Mr Graham, who is also supporting ABF The Soldiers' Charity through his cycle ride, said: 'It's going to take me a year to do it, but I hope giving one of my good years to this challenge will help give many more good years to people with dementia. 'A cure may come too late for me, but it will help my kids. We've got man to the moon, so we'll get to the answers if we put enough into it. I hope what I'm doing will help inspire people to support Alzheimer's Research UK.' He is sharing his story in the same week a YouGov survey commissioned by Alzheimer's Research UK. Early onset Alzheimer's tends to cluster within families, sometimes with several generations affected, in which case it is called familial disease. In some of these cases, it is caused by mutations in one of three genes. People with any of these extremely rare mutations tend to develop Alzheimer's disease in their 30s or 40s. These genes, and the prevalence of their defective versions  is as follows: . These mutations are extremely rare and account for fewer than one in 1,000 cases of Alzheimer's disease. It is likely that all of those who inherit faulty versions of any of these three genes will develop Alzheimer's disease at a comparatively early age. On average, half of the children of a person with one of these rare genetic mutations will inherit the disease. People who do not inherit the mutation cannot pass it on. Someone who has two or more close relatives (a parent, brother or sister) who developed Alzheimer's disease before the age of 60, is advised to ask their GP about genetic testing and counselling for these rare mutations, who can also refer patients to a geneticist, if appropriate. Source: Alzheimer's Society . This revealed that, when asked what they think dementia is and who it affects, just 23 per cent of British adults specifically mentioned brain disease or degeneration, despite a previous survey from the charity showing more than one in three people know a close friend or family member with the condition. Hilary Evans, Director at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: 'Chris embodies everything that goes against the dementia stereotype – he's young and fit and his zest for life in the face of adversity is truly inspiring. 'Although Chris' form of Alzheimer's is rare, the tragic consequences it has had on his relatives will resonate with thousands of families across the UK who have experienced Alzheimer's. 'Chris' situation shows how profound the impact of Alzheimer's can be – this is not forgetfulness in old age, the disease is a destructive process that takes the ultimate toll. 'Our new survey data shows we have a long way to go in dementia education. We need to recognise the physical process of Alzheimer's – in doing so we'll see that there's something real we can attack and overcome with research. 'Until we do, our own misunderstanding or prejudice risks becoming the biggest barrier to research. Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'Alzheimer's is one of the key health challenges of this generation. 'Chris has my absolute backing as he undertakes this mammoth challenge in aid of Alzheimer's Research UK and ABF The Soldiers' Charity. 'Travelling unsupported on an expedition which will see him cycle 16,000 miles around the coastline of North America, Chris is a great example of someone who, when faced with a difficult diagnosis, has shown extraordinary grit and determination to overcome his circumstances and ensure that future generations can benefit from potentially life-saving research. 'These are important causes, and I urge everyone to get involved and support Chris as he sets off on this daunting, once-in-a-lifetime journey.'

The good news is scientists have now discovered a way to reduce the calorie content by 60 per cent - simply by the way it is cooked. Cooking the rice with coconut oil, and then cooling it for 12 hours in the fridge, more than halved the number of calories in the rice when it was eaten. However, doctors have previously warned that eating reheated rice can cause food poisoning, and so advise making sure the rice is steaming hot all the way through before eating it. They also advise leaving the rice in the fridge no more than a day before reheating. Scroll down for video . Scientists have discovered that adding coconut oil to rice and cooling it in the fridge for 12 hours cuts the calorie content in half . The Sri Lankan researchers experimented with 38 kinds of rice from the country. Their recommended method of preparing the rice increases the amount of resistant starch inside it, which is indigestible to the human body. Therefore this resistant starch is not absorbed and turned into energy or fat, and has no calories. The scientists found a two-step process that was able to increase the amount of resistant starch in rice by 10 times. First, they added a teaspoon of coconut oil to boiling water, adding half a cup (105g) of rice, and then either simmering it for 40 minutes, or boiling it for 20 to 25 minutes. Then, they put the rice in the fridge for 12 hours to cool. Lead researcher Sudhair  James, of The College of Chemical Sciences, Sri Lanka, said if the best variety of rice is prepared using this method, 'it might reduce the calories by about 50-60 per cent.' He said the team wanted to find food-based solutions to the problem of obesity in developing countries, where rice is often a staple food. 'We discovered that increasing rice resistant starch (RS) concentrations was a novel way to approach the problem,' he said. The coconut oil enters the starch granules in the rice during its cooking, changing its architecture so it can no longer be digested, experts explained . A cup, or 210g of rice, contains around 240 calories. Mr James explained that starch can be digestible or indigestible. Rice is made of both of these types of starch. Unlike digestible types of starch, RS is not broken down in the small intestine, where carbohydrates are normally metabolized into glucose and other simple sugars and absorbed into the bloodstream. So, the researchers reasoned that if they could transform digestible starch into RS, then that could lower the number of calories of the rice. This is because the coconut oil enters the starch granules during cooking, changing its architecture so that it becomes resistant to the action of digestive enzymes, Mr James explained. This means that fewer calories ultimately get absorbed into the body. The cooling for 12 hours is essential, but reheating the rice for consumption does not affect the RS levels, he said. He added that the next step will be to complete studies with humans to learn which varieties of rice might be best suited to the calorie-reduction process. The team also will also experiment to see if other oils besides coconut have this effect. The research was presented at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), the world's largest scientific society. Doctors warn reheated rice can cause food poisoning . Doctors warn that reheated rice can cause food poisoning. However, it's not the reheating that causes the problem but the way the rice has been stored before it was reheated. Uncooked rice can contain spores of Bacillus cereus, a bacterium that can cause food poisoning. When the rice is cooked, the spores can survive. If the rice is left standing at room temperature, the spores can grow into bacteria. These bacteria will multiply and may produce toxins that cause vomiting or diarrhoea. The longer cooked rice is left at room temperature, the more likely it is that the bacteria or toxins could make the rice unsafe to eat. How to serve rice safely: . · ideally, serve rice as soon as it has been cooked . · if that isn't possible, cool the rice as quickly as possible (ideally within one hour) · keep rice in the fridge for no more than one day until reheating . · when you reheat any rice, always check that the dish is steaming hot all the way through . · do not reheat rice more than once .

His chilling responses came just a few moments before he encouraged Patrick Sondenheimer to go the toilet and took control of the flight. Later Mr Sondenheimer is heard shouting ‘open the god damn door!’ as he desperately tried to break back into the cockpit. The exchange was revealed yesterday as pictures of Lubitz as a child and a teenager emerged, and it was claimed his girlfriend may be pregnant. Scroll down for video . New photographs: Pictures of killer pilot Andreas Lubitz as a teenager (left) and child (right) emerged yesterday, along with a yearbook entry . Grim task: Rescue workers inspect the remains of the Germanwings Airbus A320 and its victims at the site of the crash, near Seyne-les-Alpes . Passengers screamed as Mr Sondenheimer attempted to smash his way in with a crowbar after Lubitz locked him out and put the plane into a descent. But the only sound from the cockpit was Lubitz breathing as the aircraft plummeted at 3,500 feet per minute before smashing into the French Alps, killing all 150 of those on board. The transcript from the plane’s black box recorder revealed Lubitz’s responses to the landing checks and him calmly encouraging Mr Sondenheimer to go the toilet. After Mr Sondenheimer left him at the controls, he switched the autopilot from the cruising altitude of 38,000ft to 96ft – a move that was certain to crash the plane over the Alps. German investigators have found torn-up sicknotes in Lubitz’s Dusseldorf flat which showed he had hidden the extent of his illness from his employers. At least one of the medical certificates covered the day of the crash last Tuesday. The 27-year-old was also said to be ‘living on the edge’ because he feared that his deteriorating blurred vision would cost him his pilot’s licence. And his relationship with blonde maths teacher, named by German media as Kathrin Goldbach, was said to be in trouble, with local reports suggesting she may have been pregnant. Maths teacher Kathrin Goldbach – who had planned to marry Lubitz next year – reportedly told pupils that she was ‘going to be a mum.’ Search: The speed of the crash meant that most of it was obliterated and no bodies have been discovered intact . Debris: A road is now being built to the crash site in the Alps near the French town of Digne-les-Bains in an attempt to help recovery workers . She was also said to have travelled to the scene of the crash, only to arrive and discover that he was the perpetrator of the disaster. Miss Goldbach, 26, told the pupils at the Gesamtschule in Krefeld, near Dusseldorf, she was pregnant, German newspaper Bild reported. The pair met as teenagers while working together at a Burger King in his home town of Montabaur. They moved together to Dusseldorf and shared a flat after he qualified as a pilot around four years ago. They intended to marry but his constant demands and desire to be ‘in control’ meant that by the time of the crash she was looking to end their relationship. Reports emerged that police searching his flat had found a ‘small mountain of pills’ and he had apparently been refusing to take his antidepressant medication. An excerpt from his school yearbook said he would ‘become a professional pilot so as to sell his cocktails around the world’. Yesterday a British air safety expert said Lubitz was able to hide his medical problems because of a ‘gaping hole’ in the system for monitoring pilot health. Under confidentiality laws rules, which also operate in the UK, patients do not have to tell GPs where they work and doctors are not able to tell employers about any health issues because of patient confidentiality.

During snippets from the conversation, he also explains to his colleague that he had not had time to go to the toilet before they left Spain. Lubitz tells him he can go to the toilet ‘at any time’ in a tone described as ‘laconic’ by French authorities. After completing their mid-flight checks for landing, Lubitz says to Mr Sondenheimer again: ‘You can go now.’ Two minutes later Mr Sondenheimer agrees to go, and says: ‘You can take over.’ There is the sound of a seat being pushed back and a click of the closing door. Shortly afterwards there is a loud bang, like someone trying to enter the cockpit. This is followed by a ‘loud, metallic banging against the cockpit door’ – believed to be Sondheimer using a crowbar to try to break in. As the jet plunges towards oblivion an automated warning sounds: ‘Ground! Pull up! Pull up!’ The pilot is heard shouting: ‘Open the god damn door!’ when he realises they are moments from death.

A report by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections suggests the 19-year-old was an impulsive risk-taker who had ADD and experienced anxiety and depression. It stated the teenager also faced a choice between a middle-class lifestyle and that of a gangster after being exposed to a 'chaotic' family situation. The revelations were announced as close to 2,000 students marched in Wisconsin's capital to protest the fatal police shooting, while the police chief apologized. Students crowded into the rotunda of the state Capitol in the morning, chanting, waving signs and demanding justice. Scroll down for videos . Demanding justice: Demonstrators protest the shooting of Tony Robinson at the state Capitol in Wisconsin on Monday. The 19-year-old was gunned down by a white police officer in Madison on Friday . Symbolic: Students held up signs saying 'Hands Up, Don't Shoot' and raised their hands into the air as they stood on the rotunda of the building . Deadly incident: Robinson, 19, was shot by officer Matt Kenny at an apartment in Madison, Wisconsin, on Friday evening. The teenager's family have demanded that a full investigation be launched into his death . Madison police officer Matt Kenny shot Robinson on Friday evening while investigating a call that the young man was jumping in and out of traffic and had assaulted someone. Turin Carter, Robinson's uncle, said his family was calling for a thorough investigation and was concerned about the 'systematic targeting of young black males,' but did not endorse blanket anti-police sentiments. 'We are not proponents of anti-police (attitudes)... We understand that law enforcement is necessary and mandatory and we need to change our mindset about the police,' Carter said at a news conference outside the house where Robinson was shot. Standing near a memorial of candles and balloons, Carter said it was simplistic to call Robinson African American, saying he had a mixed heritage and his racial ambiguity was a central issue in his life. Many teenagers at the morning protests were from Robinson's alma mater, Sun Prairie High School. 'There is an indifference between people and police. We all need to come together,' said Ali Asafford, 15, after leaving class at Madison's East High School. The march was orderly and police presence was minimal. Plea: Turin Carter, Tony Robinson's uncle, tells the media there should be a thorough investigation into his nephew's death and is concerned about the 'systematic targeting of young black males, . Issues: Court documents revealed that Robinson suffered from mental health problems - such as anxiety and depression - and had a choice between a middle-class lifestyle and that of a gangster . Powerful image: Angelica Alv holds up a sign which reads 'Our Lives Matter' while using paint to signify blood . Gesture: Demonstrators raise their fists in unison inside the government building. Earlier on Monday the Madison police chief apologized for the deadly shooting . Officer Matt Kenny, the 12-year police veteran who shot Robinson, is on paid administrative leave while the Wisconsin Department of Justice investigates the shooting. In 2007, Kenny was involved in a fatal shooting that was found to be justified. Police Chief Michael Koval apologized on Monday after praying with Robinson's grandmother over the weekend and pledging transparency in the investigation. 'Reconciliation cannot begin without my stating 'I am sorry,' and I don't think I can say this enough. I am sorry. I hope that, with time, Tony's family and friends can search their hearts to render some measure of forgiveness,' Koval wrote in his blog. Attorney General Brad Schimel asked the public to be patient with the investigation, saying his office would not be able to disclose details since it could taint testimony from witnesses. Gathering: Madison Mayor Paul Soglin addresses a crowd of protestors on Martin Luther King Boulevard. Around 2,000 students descended on the city to protest the teenager's death on Monday . March: Demonstrators make their way down East Washington Avenue, approaching the State Capitol\\ . Official efforts to be transparent, apologetic and light-handed with protesters followed months of heightened attention to police use of deadly force across the United States. Last year, the police shooting death of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, set off weeks of protests that sometimes turned violent. Police reaction was criticized as heavy-handed, and critics were outraged at the long delay in releasing the name of the officer who shot Brown. Madison, a city of 240,000 people about 80 miles (130 km) west of Milwaukee, has a mostly white population. The city is 7 percent African-American, U.S. Census figures show. Last year, Robinson pleaded guilty to armed robbery, and was placed on probation. Sentencing documents show it was his first brush with the law, and he was not the armed person in the group that committed the robbery. Heartfelt note: Most of the protesters who had walked out of their classrooms. One had scrawled a message on a lamppost . The robbery case file includes a letter from Robinson's grandmother, Sharon Irwin, to the judge. In it, she asks for her grandson to be sentenced to probation, saying he was just following his co-defendants' lead. Robinson 'is a great kid in between being a teen and a man,' she wrote. 'That is one of his issues. Impulsive. The other is being a follower.' His aunt, Loren Carter, wrote a note to the judge asking for mercy in sentencing. She said Robinson grew up poor without his father but was kind-hearted and intelligent. Robinson's defense attorney, Michael J. Short, wrote to the judge that Robinson had taken special-education classes and had never been in trouble with the law before. Studensts and some adults stood arm-in-arm as they made their way down the streets . 'He was an easy choice for the seasoned co-defendants to manipulate into participation,' Short wrote. 'He did not give any orders but just followed the instructions meted out by the other defendants.' Keith Wessel, a Madison family law attorney who said he was married to Robinson's grandmother for a time, wrote to Short in September and told him that he raised two of Robinson's uncles and knew Robinson from birth. Wessel wrote that some branches of Robinson's family exposed him to a 'chaotic environment.' He did not elaborate but said Robinson faced a choice between a middle-class life and the 'gangsta' path. He warned if Robinson went to prison on a felony charge he would continue toward the gangster world. He said Monday he was shocked at the shooting. He said Robinson stood 6-foot-5 but was a 'teddy bear.' Remembrance: A memorial for the teenager was set up outside the apartment where he was shot. It has gradually built up with flowers and tributes . Laid down: Flowers, balloons and candles line the road near the location where officer Matt Kenny gunned down Robinson on Friday . Emotional: Destiny Marshall of Atlanta, Georgia, is consoled by friends during a protest . 'I can't imagine Tony is going to fight a cop breaking into his house,' Wessel said. 'I just don't see that as likely ... I really think we need to examine our police policies.' Concern about Wisconsin's own history of police use of deadly force prompted passage of a law last year requiring independent investigators to probe such incidents. The bill had support from police associations. The head of the local NAACP chapter said the Madison police department did not engage in the sort of racial targeting that the U.S. Justice Department found prevalent in Ferguson. 'I have observed what I think is a very effective community policing structure, and I think it makes a difference,' said Greg Jones, president of the Dane County chapter of the advocacy group.

Durst, the focus of HBO's true crime documentary series \"The Jinx,\" was charged with first-degree murder last week in the 2000 killing of his longtime confidante, Susan Berman. Now the FBI is putting out a call to local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Unsolved cases in Vermont, upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay area and Southern California are among those getting a new look, the official said. Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said it's a sign that authorities are desperate. \"They seem to be going to such great lengths to pin something else on him,\" DeGuerin said. \"They must not have much of a case to begin with.\" Durst, who authorities believe has a net worth of $100 million, has lived in numerous places and owned property in at least four states, according to court documents and public records. In \"The Jinx,\" Durst describes the time he spent living in Vermont with his first wife, Kathleen, running a health food store in the 1970s. In 1982, Kathleen McCormack Durst went missing. Durst says he last saw her when he dropped her off at a train station in Katonah, New York, and she headed to their Manhattan apartment. Her family members say they believe she's dead and that Durst is the one to blame. The case has never been solved. He's also lived in Galveston, Texas, where he admitted to shooting a neighbor and dismembering the body in 2001. He was acquitted in a 2003 murder trial after arguing he'd acted in self-defense. Last week, police searched condos Durst owns in Houston as part of the investigation into Berman's death. She was shot dead in December 2000 in her Beverly Hills, California, home. Investigators know Durst was in California the week Berman died. It's a detail Durst shrugs off in the HBO documentary,  in which he denied he had anything to do with Berman's death and said, \"California's a big state.\" Authorities investigating a decades-old cold case in Vermont said Monday that there's a connection between Durst and the case of Lynne Schulze, a college student who disappeared from Middlebury College in 1971. \"We are aware of the connection between the disappearance of Lynne Schulze and Robert Durst,\" Middlebury Police Capt. Tom Hanley said. \"We have been aware of this connection for several years and have been working with various outside agencies as we follow this lead.\" Hanley elaborated Tuesday on the nature of the connection, saying Durst owned a health food store where Schulze shopped the day she disappeared. But there is no evidence the two had met, Hanley said. DeGuerin's attorney brushed off the accusation Monday. \"You know, he may have been in Chicago when Jimmy Hoffa disappeared,\" he said. \"He's an easy target.\" The name of the health food store, \"All Good Things,\" was also the title of a 2010 film starring Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst that was a thinly veiled fictional take on the Durst case. After seeing the film, Durst reached out to director Andrew Jarecki and said he wanted to be interviewed. The interviews with Durst became the basis for \"The Jinx.\" Durst says in the documentary that he had traveled during the week of Berman's death to Trinidad, California, a small coastal city in northern California. \"It was very rural, very pretty,\" he says. And it was a place, Durst says, where he lived \"off and on.\" In Eureka, about 20 miles south, Durst has been part of another investigation. Authorities there say they haven't ruled out the possibility he could be connected to the disappearance of Karen Mitchell, who went missing in November 1997 when she was 16 years old. The police chief said investigators were interested in learning what Durst has to say about that case now that he's behind bars. \"We are certainly interested in any information that may or may not come out of interviews with Mr. Durst,\" Police Chief Andy Mills said. \"If information comes to us that allows us to further our investigation, then we will certainly take the opportunity to do that.\" According to local news reports at the time of Mitchell's disappearance, she was last seen leaning into a light blue car that she might have gotten into. A witness gave police a description of the man behind the wheel, which resulted in a sketch of a gray-haired man with glasses -- a drawing that journalist Matt Birkbeck says looks remarkably like Durst. \"He wears these wide-rim glasses. He was wearing those glasses back in the day and it's also in the composite,\" said Birkbeck, whose book, \"A Deadly Secret,\" chronicles Durst's life and run-ins with the law. \"Durst apparently knew Karen Mitchell. Karen had volunteered at a homeless shelter in Eureka, which Durst had frequented, which he had a habit of doing in different cities,\" Birkbeck said. He'd also gone to a shoe store that Mitchell's aunt ran at a mall in Eureka, Birkbeck said. The former lead investigator on the case,  Dave Parris, retired several years ago and could not be reached for comment. In 2003, he told The Journal News that there were similarities between Durst and the composite sketch. \"He's a lead we're following,\" Parris told the newspaper, \"and with all the information we've learned about him, I'm not fully comfortable that I can eliminate him from our investigation at this point.\" Investigators looking at other cases across the country have their work cut out for them, Birkbeck said. \"In 2002, when my book was first published, we reported that police found six addresses in the San Francisco Bay area alone. Some of them were properties, some of them were post offices, some of them were warehouse facilities. There were other address in Northern California, Southern California, as well as other parts of the country,\" he told CNN's \"Erin Burnett: Outfront.\" But the investigation is nothing new, he said. \"They've been looking at this for several years now,\" he said. \"I guess with recent events, they've really expanded their scope.\" CNN's Jean Casarez contributed to this report.

For Wisconsin residents decrying the death of unarmed teen Tony Robinson, the question isn't even an issue. \"The investigation is being conducted by the state. We have a new law here in Wisconsin where departments are no longer conducting their own internal investigations for officer-involved shootings,\" Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said. In fact, Wisconsin is one of only two states with such legislation. The other is Connecticut. And that brings some comfort to Robinson's family. \"I trust Wisconsin and the way they're handling the investigation,\" Robinson's uncle Turin Carter told reporters. \"We spoke to investigators from DCI (Department of Criminal Investigation). We trust them, and we trust them to handle this with integrity and to treat it as it comes. We don't want our biases involved, we don't want anybody else's. We want them to act strictly as fact-finders, and that's what we believe in, and we have confidence in that.\" Wisconsin's law, which was enacted just last April, requires \"an investigation that is conducted by at least two investigators ... neither of whom is employed by a law enforcement agency that employs a law enforcement officer involved in the officer-involved death.\" After that, investigators must provide a report to the district attorney. If the district attorney determines there are no grounds to prosecute the officer involved, then the investigators must release their report to the public. Connecticut's law requires the state's Division of Criminal Justice with investigating any deadly force by law enforcement, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The state's chief attorney can appoint a special prosecutor, and the law also allows anyone to make a written request to the chief attorney to appoint a special prosecutor, the NCSL said. After that, Connecticut's Division of Criminal Justice must submit a report to the state's chief attorney detailing whether the use of deadly force was appropriate. While such laws are rather novel, a dozen other states have proposed measures about appointing special prosecutors for, or providing independent investigation in, officer-involved deaths, according to the NCSL. They include California, Connecticut, New York, Texas, Missouri, Minnesota, West Virginia, Kansas, Illinois, Tennessee, Mississippi, Oklahoma. \"Typically it doesn't work when you have to police yourself,\" said Mel Robbins, a CNN legal analyst who has began her career as a New York City public defender and now practices criminal law for Legal Aid Criminal Defense Society. \"This is why we have whistle blower protective statutes because people inside an organization will do everything they can to shut that person up. \"Having laws that require an outside agency to investigate would actually help police and prosecutors,\" she said. \"There's a suspicion that many have that police are corrupt. Many are not, but that is the perception. To begin to address that, these laws are needed.\" She noted the case of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old Cleveland boy who was playing with a pellet gun when an officer shot him dead in November 2014. After they were pressured from the child's family and the public, the police released  surveillance footage that showed that officers who arrived on the scene before the shooting did not administer first aid to the boy. Robbins thinks it's best to let a unit of prosecutors within the attorney general's office to review police-involved shootings rather than create an entirely new outside agency. CNN legal analyst and former New York City prosecutor Paul Callan said there are several reasons why outside entities, such as special prosecutors, aren't tasked with reviewing police shootings. \"Traditionally, elected district attorneys think they've done a fair and reasonable job with cases,\" he said. \"And frankly they perceive (appointment of a special prosecutor) as an insult and an attack on their integrity. It implies they are incapable of investigating police.\"There are \"powerful political forces lobbying against this kind of legislation,\" Callan said. It's also very costly to create parallel investigative structures just for police shootings, he said, and when budgets are already stretched thin, the idea of creating a new bureaucracy isn't appealing. Callan also noted the possibility that the appointment of a special prosecutor could work against minorities in certain situations. \"For the first time we are seeing minorities coming to political power in large U.S. cities and getting to the point where they can elect African-American or Hispanic district attorneys,\" he said. \"If a special prosecutor is appointed by a governor -- maybe a governor who is white who would appoint someone who is white -- does that really work to answer the call (for justice)? In the end you could have minorities deprived of power and not treated fairly by the system.\" Though Wisconsin's law has been in place for less than a year, it has already been applied in another officer-related killing. Milwaukee police officer Christopher Manney shot Dontre Hamilton, a mentally ill man, more than a dozen times last April.  The officer said he opened fire when Hamilton grabbed his baton and struck him with it. Manney was not charged in the death, but he was fired for not following protocol. Robinson's death stirred memories of two other unarmed men killed by police: Michael Brown, who was shot by officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner, who died at the hands of New York police officer Daniel Pantaleo. But there are stark differences between Robinson's case and the two others. After Brown's death in August, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson asked the neighboring St. Louis County Police Department to investigate. The case was not investigated by the state and was referred to a grand jury -- just like  in Garner's case. \"The decisions of grand juries not to indict the officers involved in the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown raised two primary concerns,\" the NCSL said. \"First, many were worried that since the evidence on which grand juries base their assessment is sealed, there is no opportunity for public scrutiny of their decisions. \"Second, there was apprehension over the decision not to appoint a special prosecutor in either case. Some are concerned that police may receive favorable treatment due to the close proximity in which law enforcement and district attorneys work.\" Robinson's case won't just by handled by state investigators; it'll go through another layer of scrutiny by the district attorney's office, Koval said. \"The State of Wisconsin's Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) has the exclusive authority to investigate all elements of the officer involved shooting -- forensics, interviews, technology feeds, etc.,\" Koval wrote on his official blog. \"This investigation is then turned directly over to the second layer of review, the District Attorney's Office, who then makes a ruling on the question of whether there is criminal culpability on the part of my officer.\" After the deaths of Brown and Garner, President Barack Obama announced the \"Task Force on 21st Century Policing,\" aimed at strengthening trust between communities and officers and identifying which practices can be improved. The task force's interim report, released this month, calls for independent investigations and independent special prosecutors in officer-related deaths. \"The importance of making sure that the sense of accountability when, in fact, law enforcement is involved in a deadly shooting is something that I think communities across the board are going to need to consider,\" Obama said. \"We have a great opportunity, coming out of some great conflict and tragedy, to really transform how we think about community law enforcement relations so that everybody feels safer and our law enforcement officers feel, rather than being embattled, feel fully supported.\" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Julie In and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.

Heading into Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address on Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, both sides should immediately agree to a cease fire. The speech itself is a terrible mistake.  Arranging it without prior consultation with the White House was not only an affront to Barack Obama but to the Presidency itself. One would have thought that after all the uproar, Netanyahu would have caught a \"cold\" and postponed, but now that he plans to go ahead, he should at least give a measured, thoughtful address -- not the barn burner for which he is known.  But let's be clear: he also deserves a respectful hearing in Congress from both sides of the aisle. Blame for the deterioration in relations is shared here in America as well as in Israel. This conflict began on a personal level. Those close to Obama and Netanyahu say the two men took an instant dislike years ago and have since descended into loathing one another. Obama, they say, regards Netanyahu as headstrong, bombastic and reckless. Netanyahu sees Obama as weak, unreliable and priggish. The Obama team also accuses Netanyahu of timing his Congressional speech to rally Israeli voters behind him in elections two weeks away -- Bibi as Churchill standing up to the Nazis -- while Netanyahu's team is convinced Obama is desperate for a deal to burnish his legacy -- the Nobel laureate who brought peace. Each thinks the other endangers the future of the world and each has allowed his top lieutenants to viciously attack the other in the press. But in recent months what began as personal antipathy has deepened and widened into a serious split over the best way to head off Iran's aggressive push to become a nuclear power.  The Iranian threat has long been vexing; former Defense Secretary Bob Gates once told me it was the toughest problem he saw in nearly a half century serving of distinguished service in national security.  There are no obvious solutions acceptable to key parties. The Obama administration believes that a compromise agreement with Iran limiting -- but not dismantling -- its nuclear capability is better than to have current talks fall apart, risking an armed showdown.  The Netanyahu government believes the agreement which Obama appears ready to accept will let Iran eventually wriggle free and build a bomb. In truth, there is merit to both points of view -- and the devil here is not only in the details but in the very structure of an agreement.  As Obama believes, a negotiated settlement is far preferable to a possible war or learning to live with a nuclear Iran. But what is alarming not only to Israel but to other American friends in the region -- and rightly so -- is that the U.S. and its partners in the negotiation with Iran (Russia, China, the UK, France, Germany) have made repeated concessions to get an Iranian signature without getting major concessions in return. Consider: The U.S. and Israel started down the negotiating path saying publicly that Iran must totally dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of punishing economic sanctions against Teheran.  Leaks since then have shown that in pursuit of a deal, the U.S. is now willing to accept more and more centrifuges in Iran -- 6,500 by latest count. Washington and Tel Aviv once talked of an agreement that would last at least 20 years. ​ According to the latest leaks, the agreement may only cover 10 years and then give the Iranians a chance to bust loose.  This is only the beginning of a long litany of differences. In defense of U.S. compromises, Secretary of State John Kerry makes a persuasive point that a temporary agreement reached 18 months ago containing compromises has worked far better than critics have conceded and therefore, those now at the table deserve a benefit of doubt. But administration critics are also right in arguing that the Obama administration seems to be betting that if just given a few years grace, an odious regime which sponsors terrorism across the Middle East will suddenly change spots and become a partner for peace. In times past, American and Israeli leaders have sometimes had bad blood and still made substantive progress.  President Jimmy Carter could barely stand Israeli leader Menachem Begin but they and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat shaped the Camp David accords in 1978. Despite sometimes bitter words during Israel's recent dust-up with Hamas -- especially directed by Israel against Secretary Kerry -- Obama ensured that Israel was well supplied militarily, particularly with the Iron Dome missile defense system that saved countless Israeli lives. But today's rift seems far more perilous.  It is not only personal but substantive and comes at a moment of spreading turmoil across the Middle East.  Israel should remember that America is its best friend in a world where anti-Semitism is once again raising its hideous head.  The United States should appreciate that for Israel, a nuclear Iran could pose instant annihilation. America also has Arab friends in the Middle East who have vital interests here -- friends like Saudi Arabia who, if an agreement is weak, will feel compelled to pursue their own bomb, unleashing a lethal arms race. This is a moment that demands that leaders in both Israel and the United States lower their voices, take their differences indoors and begin restoring broken bonds of trust.  In private talks, they should work hard finding ways to bridge differences between them, starting with creative proposals coming recently from veteran U.S. diplomats. Dennis Ross, for example, argues that if the U.S. could greatly strengthen an inspections regime -- a much bigger team who could go anywhere, any time in Iran -- and could enshrine in legislation that Iranian violations will bring military action, that would go a long way toward allaying opposition fears.  Martin Indyk proposes that, drawing upon ideas embraced by President Clinton in Middle East negotiations 15 years ago, the U.S. could enter a formal treaty with Israel, voted upon by Congress, that would provide a U.S. \"nuclear guarantee\" to Israel in event of an Iranian breakout. In short, the moment is dire but not hopeless.  What is clearly needed is a cease fire.  Secretary Kerry seemed to be pointing in that direction Sunday when he said Netanyahu is welcome to speak in the U.S. on Tuesday.  Others should now take up the cause, recognizing that our real adversaries are not in Tel Aviv or Washington but among those in Teheran who support terror and mayhem across the Middle East.

Critics raised concerns about a quiet change to the civil service code, which they warned could ‘stifle whistleblowing’ and open government.

Downing Street was understood to have intervened in the row, forcing the Cabinet Office to offer a series of concessions. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude agreed to redraft guidance to ‘strengthen protection’ for those speaking out to blow the whistle on scandals or abuses of public money, and include a commitment to being ‘as open as possible’ with Parliament and the public. However, that is unlikely to appease critics, who have asked why such a change has been enforced just before the general election campaign. It appears to have been agreed by Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, who has been nicknamed Sir Cover-Up for preventing the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq War from seeing letters and records of phone calls between Tony Blair and George Bush. However, the impetus is understood to have come from ministers, who wanted to control the flow of information from departments to make clear that they, not civil servants, are ultimately in charge. A line has been added to the civil service code, which governs officials’ conduct, saying: ‘Ensure you have ministerial authorisation for any contact with the media.’ Margaret Hodge, who chairs the Commons public accounts committee, said the Cabinet Office was ‘using a sledgehammer to crack a nut’. Margaret Hodge (pictured) said the Cabinet Office was ‘using a sledgehammer to crack a nut’ ‘You don’t want to encourage briefing against ministers, or criticising people behind their backs,’ she said. ‘But the more openness, the more understanding people have of the way government works, the better.’ Tory MP Charlotte Leslie, who has championed more openness in the health service, said it could stifle whistleblowing. ‘It makes sense that the Government wants to get its work done without a running commentary from inside the system, but I would like them to set out what they have in place to help people whistleblowing,’ she said. Ministers point that out civil servants can blow the whistle on a major scandal using legal protections afforded to them in the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1988. But Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union that represents civil servants, said it was absurd to enforce a ‘blanket ban’ on all 430,000 civil servants having unauthorised contacts with journalists. Mr Penman: ‘Civil servants will become worried about every contact they have with the media, and will be looking over their shoulder all the time when talking to the public – as that’s who they are talking to through the media – about the service they deliver.’ The Cabinet Office insist that the amendment will not affect contacts between journalists and press officers or advisers who regularly speak to the media. They insist it simply ‘clarifies’ current practice. Mr Maude last night: ‘The Cabinet Secretary and I are both clear that no one should be exposed to personal and professional risk for doing what is in the public interest. ‘The amendments make no change to the rights of individuals under whistleblowing legislation or our drive to increase Government transparency and openness. 'However, we will consult on strengthening the protections for whistleblowers.’ [Possible prompt] Write a summary about the contentious plans to bar 430,000 civil servants from talking to journalists being agreed by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood.", "chosen": "Write a summary about the row over highly contentious plans to bar 430,000 civil servants from talking to journalists.

United have the benefit of home advantage but the Gunners are in better form - and are defending the trophy. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney says he would love to win the FA Cup this season . Rooney looks dejected during the final at Wembley in 2007 - a 1-0 defeat to Premier League rivals Chelsea . Rooney watched Everton lift the FA Cup in 1995 and the memories of that make him even more determined to match his old club's achievement. He said: 'We have an FA Cup quarter-final against Arsenal on Monday and that is massive for us. 'We haven't been to a final for a few years, we want to try to win that game and we are looking forward to that. 'Of course, I think it is a massive trophy. It is a trophy that, growing up as a youngster, I used to love watching and I was fortunate enough to see Everton lift the FA Cup in 1995 when I was nine years old. It is something which I would love to do and hopefully it can be this year.' United were 2-0 winners over Arsenal in 2011, the last FA Cup meeting between the sides since the 2005 final in Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, when the match finished 0-0 but the Gunners won after a penalty shoot-out. Rooney says he was inspired by Everton's FA Cup winners in 1995, after they beat United . Rooney scored in that shoot-out, as did Robin van Persie - for Arsenal. Van Persie and Juan Mata are the only members of the United squad to have FA Cup winners' medals, but both came with other clubs. Rooney, who has nine major honours with United, was also on the losing side in 2007 when Didier Drogba's goal in extra-time earned Chelsea a 1-0 triumph at the new Wembley Stadium. With so many of the top Premier League teams out of the competition whoever wins on Monday will have a huge chance to go all the way. Louis van Gaal said: 'It is a game, 11 v 11 on a high level.

The richest fight of all time will not come cheap either — for Sky Sports or their subscribers — even though Sky are keeping faith with their core following by keeping the base price below £20. It has taken what is described by industry insiders as ‘a very substantial offer’ for Sky to fend off fierce competition from Frank Warren’s BoxNation. Floyd Mayweather's hotly-anticipated bout with Manny Pacquiao will be shown on Sky Sports . Pacquiao headed for the playground after working out in Los Angeles previously . The price for the fight has been set at £19.95 until midnight of Friday May 1. The cost will remain the same for those paying via remote control or online, but will be £24.95 if booked via phone after Friday. Sky are flirting with their threshold of £20 by charging £19.95 a buy on their Sports Box Office channel until midnight on May 1, rising to £24.95 on May 2, the day of the fight in Las Vegas. Since they are understood to have broken past protocol by offering the US promoters a cut of that revenue as well as a hefty up-front payment, it is expected they will have to shatter the pay-per-view record in this country to break even. The current Sky record stands at 1.2million buys for Ricky Hatton’s Vegas loss to Mayweather in 2007. Warren is believed to have offered a higher lump sum than Sky in the hope of attracting another two million customers to his £12-a-month subscription channel.

Frustrated with how long it is taking to get approval for its flying delivery service in the US, Amazon is said to have approached the British Government to launch a trial of the technology in Britain. Transport minister Robert Goodwill revealed the plans at a press conference for driverless cars and wider technologies earlier today. Amazon has approached the British Government about trialling its flying Amazon Prime Air service in the UK, transport minister Robert Goodwill has confirmed. One of its prototype delivery drones is pictured . ‘I had some people from Amazon coming to see me the other day; they want to replace van deliveries with drone deliveries, and they can’t do any trials in the US because they’re over-regulated,’ he said. ‘So my favourite word is deregulation, and we need to make sure that wherever you are in the world, and if you want to innovate and you want to invest in this sort of technology, come to the UK because we’re here to help you.' The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US last week approved Amazon’s plan to begin testing drones for online deliveries, though the e-commerce firm first made the request in July last year. But in the time it took to approve the use of its first-generation drone,  Amazon has developed a new version, which makes the ruling 'obsolete'. So the firm is setting its sights on foreign markets. The project, called Amazon Prime Air, was first revealed in a YouTube video in late 2013. The company is developing drones that can fly at speeds of 50 miles per hour (80 kph), operate autonomously and sense and avoid objects. Amazon’s Paul Misener wrote in a letter to the FAA in December: ‘Without approval of our testing in the United States, we will be forced to continue expanding our Prime Air R&D footprint abroad.’ Under US law, operating drones for commercial purposes is illegal, however it is allowed in the UK if permission is granted by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The FAA is said to be currently reviewing its rules on drones, with new regulations expected to be announced in the near future. Amazon is developing aerial vehicles as part of Amazon Prime Air. The aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds (2kg). About 86 per cent of Amazon's deliveries are five lbs or less, the company said. 'We believe customers will love it, and we are committed to making Prime Air available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so,' Amazon has said. In the US, the flying of unmanned aircraft, including recreational drones, is banned above 400ft (122m). Any flight that takes place within five miles (8km) of an airport can also only occur once air traffic control has been notified. The UK’s CAA has laid out guidelines for drone users that specify that unmanned aircraft must always be flown within the ‘line of sight’ of the pilot, which it generally measures at 1,600ft (488m) horizontally and 400ft (122m) vertically. This remains a stumbling block for Amazon and other companies as it means they would only be able to deliver items within 1,600ft (488m) of their warehouses. So far, law enforcement of drone regulation breaches in the UK appear to have been relatively tolerant. Chief inspector Nick Aldworth, of the Metropolitan Police, told a House of Lords select committee on piloted aircraft systems that tourists had been caught flying drones in parts of central London, despite laws restricting use close to buildings and congested areas. ‘We have decided not to enforce the legislation that exists, even though they were in contravention of it, because it did not seem proportionate,’ he said. Chinese internet giant Alibaba is also currently carrying out its own private trials of drone technology for deliveries. A new website allows homeowners to register the sky above their property as a no fly zone for drones. 'NoFlyZoneUK.org is the first site in the UK to introduce the vast benefits which the drone industry will inevitably bring,' says John Tansley, its Managing Director. 'In fact the service is intended to benefit the public, the drone industry and the UK Government. 'Our hope is that in allowing the public to request that their property become a no fly zone, then this will address the privacy concerns which have been mooted by the relevant authorities.' A new website allows homeowners to register the sky above their property as a no fly zone for drones. An example of a map marking such zones is shown . The company will monitor and record drone traffic so its service can provide a 'rapid drone intercept solution' to prevent hostile incidents such as a terrorist attack. Mr Tansley, who has previously served in HM Forces and in the Metropolitan Police, believes the service will allow the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) industry to establish itself in the UK. 'As our database grows, it will help services such a Amazon’s Prime Air, DHL’s drone delivery service and Google’s Project Wing among others realistically get a foothold in the UK while simultaneously addressing current security and privacy concerns,' he added. NoFlyZoneUK.org will be able to monitor and track all drone, UAV, Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) and Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) flights and share this information with the public.

Marie Louise Campbell, 45, was looking forward to moving into the house after viewing it on November 17 last year and putting in a £145,000 offer which was accepted the following day. But when she and her fiance David Alonzi, 46, received the keys and tried to move in last month, they were shocked at what they found. Scroll down for video . Marie Campbell and her fiance David Alonzi pictured with faeces and urine-covered debris in their new home . Animal waste can be seen smeared on the wall (left) while wooden panels (right) are noticeably stained . The carpet was so wet with animal urine it had to soaked through to the joists, Ms Campbell claimed . When they entered the property Ms Campbell said she was hit with a smell so strong it could 'knock you out' She claims she was hit with a foul pong that could 'knock you out' when she picked up the keys and unlocked the front door. Faeces were splattered up the walls and urine covered the floors to the point that the carpets and floorboards needed to be removed. Horrified Ms Campbell and her fiance, David Alonzi, 46, believe the property in Crossgates, Dunfermline, Fife, was used as a dog run in the months following their viewing and accepted offer. Ms Campbell said: 'When we got the brochure and viewed (the house), it looked fantastic, beautifully presented. It ticked all the boxes of what David and I were looking for.' After there were delays finalising some of the contract details - known in Scotland as the missives - she received the keys on January 22, just over 10 weeks after viewing the property. 'When we got the keys we could not believe what was in front of us. We opened the front door and it was cat p*** I could smell. 'I have never seen anything like it in my life. There were yellow marks at the door entrance. I went to have a smell and it nearly knocked me out. 'There are poo and pee stains on the terracotta carpet. It was absolutely saturated wet with pee. We still have all the evidence locked in the garage. 'The carpet was wet. It was soaking. It went through to the underlay which was like a baby's nappy. Ms Campbell and her fiance David Alonzi believe the property in Dunfermline, Fife, was used as a dog run in the weeks before they moved in . Floorboards and carpet had to be pulled up as the couple tried their best to rid themselves of the smell . 'We lifted the carpet up and the actual floorboard itself was wet. We then realised how extreme this was as urine had soaked all the way through to the joists. 'We couldn't understand how bad the hallway smelled until we cut two feet of plaster from the floor up in the hall.' She believes the former owner of the house, a prison officer, was leaving her animals unattended in the property during 12-hours shifts. She spoke to neighbours who said the two dogs - believed to be boxers - and three cats did not get out very often. The former owner allegedly told her that the property was 'a wee bit dodgy' but that she would make it 'immaculate' for them to move in. Richard Peters, a house surveyor working for Allied Surveyors Scotland, said he checked the property on October 21 last year. Ms Campbell points out where animal waste was left smeared against a wall . Marie Campbell and David Alonzi pictured outside the home they purchased - which they are say they cannot even live in . This picture, taken of the home as it was advertised in the estate agents' brochure, show it in perfect living condition prior to the sale . The living room looked modern, clean and tidy, prior to its alleged use as a dog run . The kitchen was also orderly prior to the damage caused by what was suspected to be animal waste . Pictured is the back section of the property, where building materials and animal-waste covered debris now lies . He said: 'It wasn't like that when I saw it. I would say at the time that there was no evidence of squelching underfoot or evidence of these horrible substances in accessible areas when I saw the house.' The couple have spent their life savings and say they cannot afford to live or fix the property properly - which they estimate would cost at least £10,000. The couple have now been forced to rent a flat for £500 each month, as they cannot move into the 'health hazard'. Scottish property law differs to that in the rest of the UK. Once a formal written offer has been accepted in writing, both parties are bound to the transaction by contract. Failure by one party to adhere to this written agreement, known as the 'missives' procedure, can mean they must pay the other party a hefty compensation fee. A sale contract is commonly known as 'concluded missives' - with the missives being the correspondence which completes the transaction. Across the rest of the UK, either party can withdraw from the transaction up until the point when a contract is officially signed. Ms Campbell said: 'I feel helpless because I can't do a thing. 'I just can't see myself ever settling in there after everything we've gone through with all the deception and lies we've been told. 'We are really struggling to do anything about this. We are currently renting a flat costing us £500 a month. 'We cannot move into this house in that condition, it's an absolute health hazard. 'Even after scrubbing the house for two weeks with enzyme cleaner and bleach, we couldn't get rid of the terrible smell.' Adrian King, of selling agent Remax, Dunfermline branch, added: 'The house was marketed by office and viewed and inspected by the purchaser who then preceded to purchase the property. 'Any deterioration in the property which may have occurred in the intervening period between the inspection and purchase, is a matter to be resolved between the respective purchasers, vendors and solicitors.' Kate McQuillan, understood to be the former owner, was not available for comment. Her solicitors sent a letter to the solicitors of Marie Louise Campbell and David Alonzi, which states: . ‘With regards to the carpets and floorboard, [Ms Quillian] is very upset at the allegation the dogs had been urinating through the whole house. ‘She offered to touch bits up in the kitchen where the dogs slept and your client told her not to bother. ‘Our client will not be meeting the cost of replacement floorboards.

Karen was so pleased with the results she wanted more surgery and taking Mr Smith's concerns on board, she opted to have more serious operations, a tummy tuck and thigh lift, in the UK . In late 2010, Karen made a doctors appointment to start the process of having the skin removed. She said: 'All the procedures I’d need came in at £35,000. I couldn’t afford to have it done privately this time and it was making me severely depressed.' After being turned down for a loan, Karen’s depression caused her to tell Mr Smith to leave her. She said: 'We’d been together 22 years, had spent so long really happy but I couldn’t remember the last time we’d had sex.

School friends Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, left east London for Turkey last month before crossing into an ISIS-controlled area of Syria. The Bethnal Green Academy pupils are feared to have reached the conflict zone to become so-called 'jihadi brides' with ISIS. Scroll down for video . Anguish: The families of three missing London schoolgirls have travelled to Turkey to retrace their steps . Questions: The families hope to find clues that may help them find or even contact their daughters . Emotional: The families went to the Istanbul coach station where the teenagers boarded their bus to Syria . On the journey, their families went first to the Istanbul coach station where the teenagers waited 18 hours in the biting February chill for their bus to the Syrian border. There they spoke to a man who unknowingly let the girls in. He told ITV News they were 'smiling as they arrived' and 'smiling as they left'. Renu Begum, sister of Shamima, told ITV News: 'This is our next step basically to get the message out to them that we've followed them all the way out here. We want them to know that we love them.' Halima Khanom, sister of Kadiza, said: 'I don't really recognise my sister, the video and the CCTV that we saw. Because this is just not her and we just want to understand her, you know, to find some answers and get some help.' Abase Hussein, father of Amira, said: 'I don't know how to explain. I can't describe my feelings. I feel like my girl is next to me when I find someone that's on their last journey who saw them. I feel like my daughter is next to me - that's the feelings I have.' Searching for clues: At the bus station, the family spoke to a man who unknowingly let the three girls in . Tears: The families struggle to hide their emotions as they retraced the steps of the London schoolgirls . The families left through the same door as the girls at the bus station, and family lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said: 'Of course they feel responsible for their own children, that goes without saying. 'But the fact is these girls were school children and much of what took place clearly took place at school. Police put a cap on information that they and the school were giving back to the parents.' The east London schoolgirls flew to Istanbul from Gatwick with Turkish Airlines and now believed to be in based in the Syrian town of Raqqa – the Islamic State's self-declared capital. Last week it emerged that Sharmeena Begum, 15, a close friend of the trio and a fellow pupil at Bethnal Green Academy, left Britain before them in December. There are suspicions the trio kept in touch with Sharmeena who passed on information about how to follow in her footsteps. Those closest to all four girls suspect they were groomed by Islamists using social networking sites and secretive internet messaging software. The families have criticised police and others for failing to stop them. But their plight has raised questions about why the families themselves did not spot their conversion to radical Islam. Scotland Yard chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has said the three schoolgirls would not face prosecution if they returned home. Familiar route: The families, along with ITV's Rohit Kachroo, flew in to Istanbul from Gatwick . Looking for answers: By retracing the route of the schoolgirls, the families hope it might bring them home . Elsewhere last week, three British teenage jihadists were placed in custody after a dramatic security operation prevented them joining ISIS in Syria. A pair of 17-year-old schoolboys and a 19-year-old man, all from North-West London, were intercepted in Turkey after their parents realised they had fled to join the terrorist group. They dialled 999 and British police quickly tipped off their Turkish counterparts. Officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in Istanbul. Security services say 600 British Muslims have gone to fight in Syria and around 60 of them are young women. They include 22 women and girls who have travelled in the past 12 months, many of whom wanted to become 'jihadi brides'. ISIS currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq, and has attracted thousands of foreign fighters to its cause. Turkey has faced criticism for not controlling its border with Syria, but has accused European states of failing to prevent would-be jihadists from leaving in the first place.

The live-in girlfriend of an accused child molester from Indiana allegedly had helped the suspect arrange sexual encounters with young girls, according to recently unsealed court documents. Mark Speer, 44, a plumber from Lafayette, was arrested in August on suspicion of molesting a 3-year-old girl and creating child pornography videos. In the course of the investigation into the claims, police received permission to access Speer's private messages on Facebook and the dating site Zoosk exchanged between him and his girlfriend, Rebecca Kaster. Search warrants released last month state that Kaster had assisted her boyfriend in scheduling his illicit encounters with children. One Facebook message sent from Kaster's account to Speer December 22, 2013, read: 'i think i have the best chance getting her or the younger [girl]...so far that’s all i got.' Speer reportedly replied that Kaster's update turned him on. Kaster, who has not been charged with any crime, told detectives that she and Speer had an open relationship, in which he was allowed to have sex with other women he met online, according to the court documents cited by Indianapolis Star. Speer was charged last September with child molesting, attempted child molesting and criminal confinement, along with federal child pornography charges, . The charges against the 44-year-old stemmed from the discovery of a half-dozen videos on his cell phone featuring a 3-year-old girl in his house wearing nothing but a pair of socks. Go-between: Speer's live-in-girlfriend, Rebecca Kaster, is suspected of helping the Indiana plumber (left and right) arrange encounters with young victims via Facebook and Twitter . When questioned by Indiana State Police in August about the videos, Speer claimed he recorded them because the toddler was 'acting goofy' and 'dancing around.' Court papers released last fall revealed that in one of the clips, Speer is heard saying about the child: 'This pretty little thing's mind, ' and, 'Oh my God, I’ve already got her naked.' The suspect told police the girl's mother took off her clothes after the 3-year-old had spilled ice cream of herself. Kaster, Speer's girlfriend, told detectives that she had been babysitting the little girl when she left her boyfriend alone with her for up to 30 minutes.

The tricky winger scored and set up another in Palace’s win which left Queens Park Rangers deep in the relegation quagmire. When the debate rages about who should play in the Under 21 tournaments, Barclays Premier League managers often prefer their stars to skip them. Wilfried Zaha celebrates with Crystal Palace team-mates after his opener at Selhurst Park on Saturday . Shaun Wright-Phillips made his first Premier League start for 770 days. But Pardew has taken the unusual step of backing Zaha for the tournament and will speak to Southgate about including him. ‘I would love Wilf to be on that trip because that is a big tournament for England,’ Pardew said. ‘Particularly after the Champions League results this year and England didn’t do well in the World Cup so I think Gareth should have the best players available and I’m hoping Wilf is one of them. But Gareth’s choice won’t be determined by a phone call from me, he is his own man. ‘Wilf has definitely found himself a little bit more and I think Gareth would like somebody in the squad who has the kind of quality that he does. But he’s got to do it between now and the end of the year and push for a place in that squad — that should be a goal for him.’ Zaha’s counterpart on the opposite flank Yannick Bolasie also starred in the victory, twice beating QPR’s teenage right-back Darnell Furlong to get to the byline and send in low crosses — one for Zaha’s goal and the other for James McArthur to score. Zaha slides in to open the scoring during the 3-1 win over relegation threatened Queens Park Rangers . Furlong was run ragged and eventually hooked at the break. Bolasie admitted he targeted the 19-year-old as a weak link in the team. ‘My aim was to go at him straight away,’ he said. ‘He ain’t going to come here and I’m not going to let him settle, so that was my aim to be honest. I know it’ s cruel, that’s football. ‘A couple of the players spoke to me and I wasn’t aware [of him], because I don’ t really look at the opposition like that. But that was the aim.’ Furlong was at least not at fault for the third goal, which came from the other flank when Zaha tricked his way through a couple of players before passing to Joel Ward to net for Palace for the very first time. Yannick Bolasie (left) was in great form to provide two assists for Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon . QPR’s Matt Phillips scored a goal-of-the-season contender with a 40-yard drive in the final 10 minutes, but it was too late and defeat left them four points adrift of safety. Manager Chris Ramsey laid part of the blame on his players, saying: ‘They have realised there are only a certain amount of things you can do in preparation but you have to transfer it in the game. ‘Sometimes I go and watch games and don’t get in until 2am. Sometimes I wake up early and watch a DVD of the other teams. Me doing extra hours is not going to make any difference to them.’ [Possible prompt] Write a summary about Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew encouraging Wilfried Zaha to aim for a place in Gareth Southgate’s England squad for the European Under 21 Championship this summer.", "chosen": "Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew has encouraged Wilfried Zaha to aim for a place in the England Under 21 squad for the European Championships this summer.", "rejected": "Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew has urged Wilfried Zaha to play in the European Under 21 Championship this summer, despite the fact that other Premier League managers often advise their players to skip these tournaments.

And in just two and a half months last summer one family of five munched their way from the post-war era to modern times to reveal how dramatically things have changed. The Robshaws found the 1950s wholegrain National Loaf particularly hard to stomach, and ten-year-old Fred was overjoyed when sweets came off the ration. The Robshaw family took on a culinary challenge to eat as a family would have in each decade from the 1950s to the 1990s. Pictured (from left) Rosalind, mother Rochelle, Fred, father Brandon and Miranda 'in the 1950s' Forty years later, the Robshaws found themselves eating in the Nineties, sampling such delights as homemade pasta. 'Within living memory, the way we eat has been utterly transformed,' remarked Mr Robshaw . The experiment, filmed for a six-part TV programme, ended with the family feeling extremely grateful for the variety of foods available today. Back In Time For Dinner, which starts on BBC2 next Tuesday, follows the Robshaws – Brandon, 53, Rochelle, 52, and their children Miranda, 17, Rosalind, 15 and Fred – from the 1950s to the end of the millennium, with the final episode casting an eye towards the future of food. In the 1950s the children had to wait patiently for their father to finish his dinner, knowing his leftovers would be their supper. The 1960s saw the birth of the sugary cereal, while motorway service stations became almost fashionable as places to eat. Vesta convenience meals were available and the more adventurous home cooks could buy exotic foreign ingredients such as garlic and olive oil – from the chemist. Baking supremo Mary Berry teaches the Robshaws how to make a cake as it would have been done in the 1950s (pictured) for the six-part TV programme 'Back In Time For Dinner', which airs on BBC next Tuesday . The Hairy Bikers' Dave Myers pictured with the Robshaw family as they sample the food of the Sixties . In the early 1950s, families ate bread - often the rationed 'National loaf' - and left-over roasted meat fat aka 'dripping' for breakfast (left), before Cornflakes (right) made their first appearance in the UK in the 1960s . In the 1970s, working women were learning to balance their careers with cooking for the family. The decade also saw the rise of the Pot Noodle. In the 1980s goats cheese, mange tout and kiwi fruit became the foods to impress your dinner party guests. Gourmet dishes and nouvelle cuisine took over from the simple but hearty dishes of earlier decades. By the 1990s, sushi and curry were as popular as traditional English dishes and ready meals became the norm. The programme also shows how fridges, freezers, microwaves and even televisions revolutionised the way the country ate, and how the rise of supermarkets changed shopping forever. The Robshaws found that food in the 1970s was brightly-coloured - but perhaps less enticing - than before . Families began to get a taste for spicier food in the sixties and  Vesta introduced an early ready meal in the shape of a beef curry. In the same era, cooks could buy  ingredients such as garlic and oil from the chemist . Spaghetti bolognese arrived in the UK from Italy in the sixties... and it hasn't left British dining tables since . Mr Robshaw, a freelance journalist and children’s writer, said 1950s-style rationing left them feeling hungry all the time and was particularly hard on Fred, who ‘literally danced with joy the day sweets came off the ration’. He went on: ‘None of us found the National Loaf easy to digest. As flour was scarce, it was padded out with potato starch.’ When the family entered the 1960s, Mr Robshaw said ‘food became fun’ thanks to the likes of fish fingers and ‘it all felt extraordinarily liberating after the austerity of the 1950s’. He added: ‘It [the show] brought home to us all how British food has been revolutionised in an incredibly short time.’ Throughout the series, in which the family saw not only their menus given an overhaul but also their wardrobes, kitchen and daily routine, they were helped by famous faces including Mary Berry and Hairy Biker Dave Myers.

But Miguel Gonzales got a little more than he bargained for when he won the girl - and a two-day suspension. Gonzales, 17, borrowed the horse from a friend's ranch and galloped right on up to Catalina Hernandez's first period class, holding a sign that said 'Will you ride with me to prom?' Miguel Gonzales, 17, got a little help from a horse named Romeo to ask Catalina Hernandez to the prom . The Milpitas High School senior got the idea from the school's Spirit Day theme, which was 'salad dressing day'. He dressed up as a cowboy, boots and all, to represent ranch dressing. Hernandez was dressed in a toga to symbolize Caesar salad. Hernandez and her peers ran out of their classrooms, phones in hand, and she quickly said yes. But the students' principal was hardly excited by the grand gesture. 'I was there for a bit and I knew people would come like security so I tried to leave,' Gonzales told the San Jose Mercury News. The Milpitas High School senior was suspended for his grand gesture, as the school deemed the horse was a 'potential threat' to other students walking in the same path. But Gonzales will still be able to attend the prom . 'But on my way I heard the principal screaming... I kind of knew I was going to get into trouble.' Gonzales said he expected to get detention or Saturday school, but had no idea he could face suspension. District Superintendent Cheryl Jordan said Gonzales was suspended because the horse was a 'potential threat' to other students who where 'walking in the same path.'

Alex Salmond has threatened to bring down a Conservative minority government, even if David Cameron wins more seats than Ed Miliband. The former Scottish First Minister said the Scottish National Party would vote down a Tory Queen's Speech if it holds the balance of power after the general election. Latest polls suggest the SNP will gain dozens of seats in Scotland, depriving Labour of a majority and able to call the shots in Westminster. Mr Salmond suggested that jettisoning an attempt by the Conservatives to govern alone would allow the SNP to prop up a minority Labour administration. The Tories said it was proof the SNP would 'sabotage the democratic will of the British people' to install Mr Miliband in Downing Street. Speaking to the New Statesman magazine, Mr Salmond said the SNP could enter a 'confidence and supply' arrangement with Labour - under which the smaller party would agree not to bring down a minority government in return for concessions on particular priorities. But he said it was more probable that it would offer its support on a vote-by-vote basis and would make amendments to any budget put forward by Ed Balls to introduce 'progressive tax measures'. With opinion polls suggesting the SNP are headed for dozens of gains from Labour and the Liberal Democrats north of the border, Mr Salmond - who is standing in the Gordon seat being vacated by veteran Lib Dem Sir Malcolm Bruce - would say only that he expects the party to win 'a barrel-load' of seats at Westminster. He predicted that Lib Dems would not be 'a big factor' in negotiations on forming the new government, as 'if the Liberals are reduced to half their MPs the last thing they're going to be doing is going into a coalition'. 'The surviving half will want to survive,' he said. This would mean the SNP, unionist parties from Northern Ireland and other smaller parties would be crucial to the outcome. Mr Salmond rejected Labour's argument that the party with the most seats after the May 7 poll will have the opportunity to form the government, insisting that the key question is which leader can command a majority in the Commons. 'The Tories would have to go straight effectively for a vote of confidence - usually the Queen's Speech, although it could be otherwise, of course, and we'd be voting against,' said Mr Salmond. 'So if Labour joins us in that pledge, then that's Cameron locked out. And then under the (Fixed-Term) Parliaments Act that the Westminster parliament's passed but nobody seems to have read, you'd then have a two-week period to form another government - and of course you want to form another government because this might be people's only chance to form another government.' The SNP would act to prop up a Labour government with Ed Miliband in Number 10, even if David Cameron wins more seats . Although Mr Cameron would remain incumbent Prime Minister until a new government was formed, the Act - passed by the coalition in 2011 - would restrict his ability to call a new election in the hope of securing a decisive result, said Mr Salmond. The former SNP leader said he had 'no idea' whether a Labour government emerging from such a process would have Mr Miliband as its leader, and suggested that he was wrong to have ruled out formal coalition with the SNP so firmly . 'If I were him, I wouldn't have ruled it out,' said Mr Salmond. 'Nicola (Sturgeon, the SNP leader) has always said that she thought full coalition was unlikely. But she didn't rule it out: she said it was highly unlikely ... It's still highly unlikely.' Asked what he saw as the probable outcome, Mr Salmond said: 'I think probable would be vote-by-vote (support for Labour), and possible would be confidence and supply.' A new poll of voters in Scotland this week put Labour down to just 27 per cent, which Professor John Curtice says could leave the party with just two MPs, the same number as the Tories . Mr Salmond said it was 'bad politics' for Mr Cameron to float the prospect of English votes for English laws on the morning after last year's independence referendum and said it was now 'not a question of if, but when' a second referendum on separation from the rest of the UK would take place. A Conservative spokesman said: 'Alex Salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister. 'That would mean chaos for Britain, with weak Ed Miliband dancing to Alex Salmond's tune. The only way to protect Trident, keep Britain together and safeguard the economy is to vote Conservative.'

The former Real Madrid striker, who nearly joined Kane at Spurs as part as the deal that took Gareth Bale to Spain, settled the match in the first half in what was a largely unconvincing performance from Vicente del Bosque’s team. Franco Baldini wanted Morata to move to north London but he ended up staying in Madrid before moving to Juventus last summer. His goals have helped them into the last eight of the Champions League and he took that form with him into this Group C qualifier. Alvaro Morata opened the scoring for Spain as his looped effort evades the gloves of Andriy Pyatov . Morata beats Ukraine defender Yevhen Khacheridi to loft the ball into the back of the net .

Playing instead of the injured Diego Costa he converted a Koke pass on 28 minutes but Spain failed to find the second and still look a long way from the form they showed when they won the Euros three years ago. They also lost Jordi Alba to a groin injury in the second half. La Roja applied all the early pressure but Isco and Morata sent their first shots wide and David Silva missed the target with a diving header 12 yards out from an Isco cross. Ukraine looked dangerous on the coutner attack in the first 20 minutes and Artem Fedetsky sent a wayward volley wide of Iker Casillas’ goal from a corner. From the edge of the area Ruslan Rotan also went close, but again Spain’s goalkeeper was able to watch the ball go wide. Spain attacked with more quality than the visitors and just before the half hour they were in front when Andres Iniesta found Koke and his first time ball sent Morata through. He held off the last defender and when Ukraine keeper Andrei Pyatov went to ground early he lofted the ball over him to score. Spain then enjoyed their best spell. Silva tested Pyatov with another shot and Iniesta began to lead Ukraine a merry dance in midfield. On the day that Xavi showed up in Qatar to sign a three-year contract Spain could easily have been reminded of how much they miss him. Pyatov looks back in despair as Spain take the lead at the Estadio Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán . Morata celebrates his first international goal on his third cap for Vicente del Bosque's side . But his Barcelona team-mate was running the midfield until the break. They could have gone in at half time 2-0 up but Sergio Ramos' header from Silva’s free-kick came back off the frame of the goal. Encouraged by Spain’s narrow lead Ukraine had their chances at the start of the second half with Casillas saving Rotan’s free-kick. The keeper then gave Dnipro’s Rotan another chance kicking the ball straight to him but then parried his shot. The Juventus striker is congratulated by his team-mates as Spain made their first-half dominance pay . Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta controls the ball as Artem Fedetskiy closes in to make a challenge . That was typical of the sloppiness that had crept into Spain’s play at the start of the second period. They needed the second goal – it might have come when Iniesta fed Morata but his shot was closer to the corner flag than Pyatov’s goal and that was the last thing he did before being replaced by Pedro. At least he had his debut goal. It was still far too easy to reach the edge of Spain’s penalty area and they were saved by Ukraine not being able to make the most of arriving there – Rotan again shot straight at Casillas after meeting Yevhen Konoplianka’s cross. Manchester City midfielder David Silva is halted in his tracks by two Ukraine defenders . Real Madrid playmaker Isco evades the outstretched leg of Ukraine forward Taras Stepanenko . Spain continued to over-elaborate at one end and leave too much space at the other and when Jordi Alba went off holding his groin with 12 minutes left even Barcelona supporters were worried. They played out the final minutes to take the three points and they stay second behind Slovakia but Del Bosque will not need telling there is work to be done if they are to retain their crown in France next summer.

Upon their arrival, the Americans will be housed near the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, or Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, the CDC said. They will follow the center's  monitoring and movement guidelines during the virus's 21-day incubation period. If someone shows symptoms, they will be sent to an Ebola treatment center for evaluation. More than 10,000 people have died from Ebola - mainly in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea - since December 2013, the World Health Organization says. In total, 24,000 cases have been reported. However, only a handful of these cases have been seen in the United States, Spain and Britain. On Saturday, Thomas Skinner, of the CDC, said an investigation into the infected health worker - and the possible exposure of others - was ongoing, adding more Americans may be evacuated. The NIH, where the unidentified patient is being treated, is one of just four hospitals in the US to have a biocontainment units. It also has infectious disease specialists to care for Ebola patients.

The same facility treated US nurse Nina Pham, who was infected with Ebola while caring for Liberian patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, at a Texas hospital. Mr Duncan later died from the virus. Ms Pham, 26, and another nurse, Amber Vinson, who was also infected have since recovered. On Friday, the CDC sent a team to Sierra Leone to investigate how the latest healthcare worker became exposed to Ebola, and determine who may have been in contact with the infected person. CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said the center was working out a plan with the U.S. State Department to determine who was coming back and where they will be sent on their return. Well-equipped: The CDC said that one patient was being sent to Emory University Hospital's (pictured) special isolation unit, where several patients have already been treated for the life-threatening disease .

Four others are being sent to Nebraska Medical Center to be near their special isolation unit in case they develop Ebola symptoms. Ebola is spread through close contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. The virus can cause lethal bleeding, muscle aches, severe vomiting and diarrhea. The disease typically takes hold two to 10 days after exposure, but the full inoculation period is considered to last 21 days.

A 14-year-old boy was today fighting for his life after suffering a blood clot on his brain when he was injured playing rugby. Connor Lynes, of Hull, East Yorkshire, returned home after playing for his under-15s rugby league team on Saturday - but was found collapsed on his bedroom floor the next morning. After being taken to Hull Royal Infirmary, Connor was put in an induced coma and doctors removed 90 per cent of the clot - in a potentially life-saving operation. He was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary on Sunday, where he underwent another operation yesterday to try to remove the rest. Now, he may face a third surgery. His family are now asking people to pray for ‘little Robin’, who plays for Lambwath Lions. Connor’s uncle Dave Lynes said: ‘We want people to pray for Connor and keep their fingers crossed. We still do not know if he will pull through. It is just heartbreaking at the moment. ‘He is a cheeky little lad and he is full of mischief. He has got a heart of gold, has lots and lots of friends and is very popular at school, at his club and at Hull Kingston Rovers.’ Mr Lynes said Connor, who lives with his aunt, Sara, was injured after being tackled. He added: ‘Connor was playing rugby for his local under-15s team and took a bit of a hard hit in the tackle. They took him off straight away but he seemed fine. 'He was at home on Saturday night being his usual cheeky self. My sister got up the next morning and found him collapsed on the bedroom floor and rushed him to hospital.' Connor, who plays for Lambwath Lions, suffered a blood clot on his brain when he was injured playing rugby . Mr Lynes said it was tough for relatives to see Connor, a pupil at Winifred Holtby Academy, in hospital, adding that the family are 'totally powerless at the moment'. He said: ‘He has had such a hard life – he lost his father when he was young but is still such a cheeky lad. He is not just my nephew, but he is like a son to me as well.’ Mr Lynes said Connor loves rugby and is a huge fan of Super League side Hull Kingston Rovers. He added: 'Connor broke his leg four years ago and the doctors said he would never play rugby again. It was bad - he broke his tibia and fibula - but a year later, he was playing again. 'He loves the sport and is a massive rugby fan. He is a KR fan and I am a Hull fan and we have a lot of banter between us about it.’ Mr Lynes said: ‘Connor did come out the coma last night and is breathing unaided. He's opened his eyes and even managed a cheeky smile.’ Treated: Connor was put in an induced coma and doctors removed 90 per cent of the clot. He was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary (pictured) on Sunday, where he underwent another operation yesterday . Education: Connor, a pupil at Winifred Holtby Academy (above), is said to be 'very popular at school' Meanwhile, speaking on behalf of Connor’s family, Steve Ball, general manager of the Rugby and Football League Benevolent Fund, said he had visited the youngster at Leeds General Infirmary. The boy is still ‘very poorly’ but in a stable condition while relatives keep a vigil around his hospital bed. Mr Ball said today: ‘Thankfully he is conscious now and aware of his surroundings. He saw me and was able to give me a thumbs up. He may need to undergo a further surgery and we will find out in the next few days.’ He said that Connor had been playing in a group match for Lambwath Lions against another East Yorkshire team from Beverley. Mr Ball added: ‘It was a perfectly legitimate tackle and a freak accident really. He didn’t actually fall ill until the day after the match.’ Meanwhile, a Hull Kingston Rovers spokesman said: ‘Our thoughts are with young Connor Lynes, who is in intensive care following an injury playing the sport he loves yesterday.

Everton duo James McCarthy and Darron Gibson and Burnley defender Stephen Ward were among those who sat out training but O'Neill was not unduly concerned. Republic of Ireland's Stephen Quinn and James McClean on the ball during  training at Gannon Park . He said: 'It's not surprising really for James as Everton have played four games in the last 10 or 11 days, Seamus Coleman too. Darron Gibson has a bit of a groin problem - he played yesterday. 'Stephen has just had a little bit of difficulty. He's had an injury which he is coming back from and he's getting looked at this evening, with the club's permission, and we might have to do something about that. He's hoping maybe two or three days on that he's okay. 'Jon is coming in and he's pretty upbeat. He's got a mask and played for the last few minutes in the Stoke game and did well to put himself forward for the game, and there is this week. I think he is feeling fine and will be in later today.'

O'Neill will not be rushed in selecting his team for a huge game, and 38-year-old Given is determined to use this week to edge himself ahead of regular number one David Forde to claim his 128th senior international cap. He said: 'The goalkeepers in general, David and [Keiren] Westwood and [Darren] Randolph as well, we are all a tight team together and whoever he picks, we will support them. 'You do wish them well but at the same time, your personal pride and professionalism, you want to play in the game and because it's such a huge game as well, I would love to play on Sunday.

Dr Karen Halnon, 52, who wrote her PhD thesis on hysterical women, was arrested on board the plane for disorderly conduct as it sat on the tarmac at Miami International Airport on Saturday. She was caught on camera lighting up shortly after the flight had landed - but stubbed it out and thrust the butt into a seat pocket when flight attendants came over.

Zachary Pritchett was arrested following the deadly incident early Friday at a home in the Bridesburg section of the city. A police spokeswoman said officers responded to the home shortly after 6am Friday and found 53-year-old Melizza Wiley dead of multiple stab wounds to the face, neck and upper torso.

Pritchett's 73-year-old grandmother, Joan Wiley, was taken to Aria Torresdale Hospital in critical but stable condition. Police said Pritchett, who suffered a laceration to his hand, initially blamed the attack on three unknown men in hooded sweatshirts who he claimed had broken into their home, reported Fox29, but his version of events did not add up. According to the family's neighbors, the 19-year-old was very troubled and the violent domestic attack was years in the making. Area resident Kelly McGrath told 6ABC Melizza Wiley seldom allowed her son out of the house, and most nights he could be heard screaming from the back room. Another neighbor, Stephanie Carbonaro, said on the eve of the killing, she and her house guests overheard Zachary Pritchett screaming at someone in the house, 'Please, leave me alone. Don't do this. Let go.' Officers who responded to the family's residence found deplorable conditions inside, including no running water, no cooking gas and human feces smeared on the floor. Throughout the day Saturday, investigators were seen coming in and out of the house wearing full protective gear and surgical masks. Melizza Wiley died after sustaining multiple stab wounds to the face, neck and upper torso, while her mother was critically wounded. Neighbors say the attack was years in the making . Melizza Wiley was found stabbed in the living room and was pronounced dead at the scene at 6.27am. Joan Wiley was discovered wounded in a hospital-type bed. Police said they have a history with the family and have responded to the home no fewer than a dozen times within the past year alone. Neighbors said they have contacted the Department of Human Services multiple times because they were concerned for Zachary Pritchett’s welfare. Kelly McGrath also reached out to the local school board to inquire about the 19-year-old’s education because Melizza Wiley was supposed to be home-schooling her son, but the neighbor was convinced she was not doing it.

The Argentina international's girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo posted a picture to her Instagram account on Thursday morning wishing him 'Happy Father's Day'. Roccuzzo and two-year-old son Thiago each planted a kiss on Messi's cheek as the trio posed for a family selfie to mark the occasion. Lionel Messi poses for a family selfie on Thursday to celebrate Spanish Father's Day . Messi taunts the Man City defence on the edge of the penalty area during a classy performance . The night before Messi had produced another stunning performance and brilliantly set up Ivan Rakitic to score the only goal of the game as Barca reached the Champions League quarter-final for a record eighth consecutive season. Earlier in the season, however, Messi was subjected to intense scrutiny as he and Barcelona struggled for form. He was beaten to the Ballon d'Or trophy by Cristiano Ronaldo as rumours of transfer surfaced. But any concerns that Messi's star was fading have well and truly been dispelled since the turn of the year and, after the City game, he was quick to remind his detractors of the criticism he received. Messi joins in the celebrations with Rakitic and Luis Suarez of Barcelona's first-half goal at the Nou Camp . Messi tries to take the ball around the onrushing Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart who makes the save . 'A short while ago I was supposed to be a disaster, it's tricky to go from being a disaster to the best form of ones career,' Messi told Canal+ after the game. During Wednesday's last-16 second leg, although Messi ran the City defence ragged, he met his match against Joe Hart. The England No 1 produced one of the great Champions League goalkeeping performances to thwart Messi with several fine stops. Had it not been for Hart's heroics it could have been a humiliating defeat for Manuel Pellegrini's side and Messi, in typically sporting fashion, was quick to congratulate him. Hart thwarts Messi again as the Manchester City goalkeeper kept his side in the game . Argentina international Messi and Hart acknowledge each other's performances with a hand shake .

She wants to show me her favorite photograph of her son. It's from a few years ago. It shows Bian Liangjing standing proudly in front of a temple gate. \"This is the best one because he looks so handsome,\" she laughs as tears fall on to the album. Bian was on his way back from Singapore after working on a construction site to earn money to pay for his dentist's license. His boss decided it was cheaper to fly through Malaysia. He boarded the Beijing-bound Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 flight in Kuala Lumpur on March 8 last year when it disappeared barely an hour into its journey. No trace has ever been found despite an extensive search. But his mother is convinced he's coming back. \"If it is one year, if it is two years or three, I am looking forward to his return. I know he is still alive,\" she says. I first met family members of those who were on the airliner that night as they stood in shock at the arrivals hall of Beijing airport. I saw them every day for a month as they grappled with confusion and mixed messages from Malaysia Airlines and the Malaysian government. I was there when many received text messages saying \"none of those on board survived.\" Many had to be wheeled out on gurneys. Some lashed out at the cameras. The news cycle moved on but the families are still here. They are still in pain. And all the family members I speak to say their loved ones are alive. They never speak in the past tense, they cling onto each theory that is circulated and they refuse to sign any documents to start financial settlements. \"I think psychologically it is understandable, they choose to believe that their loved ones are still missing, so they can still have hope for them to return,\" says May Lam, a psychiatrist at The University of Hong Kong. She says the families need constant support from social workers and the government and they need to be helped to gradually accept their loss. But many say they are treated like an inconvenience. Families complain of harassment by local communist party officials, several have been detained by Chinese police for holding meetings and some say they have been barred from speaking to the international media. Both the Chinese and Malaysian governments maintain they are doing everything they can to help. Meanwhile, Bian Liangjing's family, like all the others I have met, is stuck in a vortex of grief. His brother shows me to the room where they would sleep as young boys and the corner where they kept their toys. Bian Liangwei says they were best friends and that his older brother looked after him. \"When he was here, everything was OK with our family, now everything is up to me. I hope he is somewhere alive. I just know he wants to come home soon to us,\" he says through his tears. [Possible prompt] Write a summary about a mother waiting for her son to return from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

The latest offering, \"Gift Horse,\" which took up residence in the Square's northwest corner Thursday, looks set to continue the tradition with a work that explores the link between power, money and history, according to organizers. Unveiled by London's Mayor Boris Johnson, the sculpture created by German-born conceptual artist Hans Haacke portrays a skeletal riderless horse with an ribbon-shaped electronic ticker tied to its left leg showing live market data from London's Stock Exchange. \"'Gift Horse' is a startlingly original comment on the relationship between art and commerce and I hope it will stimulate as much debate as other works that have appeared on the plinth,\" Johnson said. The 13-feet high bronze skeleton is a \"wry comment,\" organizers say, on the equestrian statue of King William IV originally planned, but never realized for the plinth more than 150 years ago. Further nods to the past and the sculpture's location can be found in the pose which is based on the engraving \"The Anatomy of a Horse\" by English artist George Stubbs, whose famous equine portraits hang on the walls of the National Gallery on Trafalgar Square's north side. One of London's most famous landmarks, Trafalgar Square is popular with tourists. Named after a famed 1805 British naval victory against the French, its centerpiece is a column commemorating Lord Horatio Nelson, who died during the conflict. In a career spanning half-a-century, Haacke has frequently explored the interconnectedness of art, power and money through installations, paintings, photography and written text. Many of Haacke's most famous works have explored systems, be it physical -- as evidenced by his famous 1960s work \"Condensation Cube\" -- or the social and political as seen in \"MoMA Poll\" (1970), \"A Breed Apart\" (1978) and more recently his \"Der Bevölkerung\" (The People) installed in Germany's Reichstag building in Berlin in 2000. \"It's a very prominent spot,\" said the 78-year-old, reflecting on the \"Gift Horse's\" positioning in Trafalgar Square,  \"It's very beautiful. Everybody sees it.\" \"There are other statues and the idea of having the empty plinth which has been made available periodically for artists is a great idea,\" added Haacke. Around Trafalgar Square there was mixed reaction to the sculpture. \"It definitely doesn't look like a horse's head, does it? Looks more dinosaur-ish to me,\" said a slightly baffled female day-tripper from Wales, while another tourist seemed equally confused. \"My first impression was that it looked like an alien, because you see it and then you think, huh? What is it?\" said Toni, visiting from Switzerland. Local reaction was more positive though. \"I just think it's very witty,\" said Londoner Tony Francis. \"I can see the (George) Stubbs influence. And I love the Stock Exchange (ribbon) scrolling round and the way they merge into each other.\" \"Gift Horse\" is the 10th artwork to sit on the plinth and follows the \"Hahn/Cock,\" created by German artist Katharina Fritsch which was in residence from July 2013 to February this year.

Scroll down for video . Fins n Fries café in North Stradbroke Island has been serving a Bali Nine burger for over four years . Owner and head chef Cameron Tobin said customers are asking: ''are you going to call it the Bali Seven in a couple of weeks time?'' Mr Tobin clarified he thought this suggestion was 'distasteful.' He claimed the burger earned its name from having nine ingredients and a Balinese sauce, rather than referencing the nine people arrested in 2005 for trying to smuggle eight kilograms of heroin into Australia. 'People have a bit of a laugh, but then I explain to them the theory behind it and tell them that there are nine ingredients on the burger,' he said. Mr Tobin discovered the recipe for the burger when travelling through southeast Asia. While it is apparently his most popular item, that could be in part due to some customers believing it contains drugs. 'It is my best seller, but I get lots of people ask me if there are illicit products used in the making of the burger,' he said.

Discovered inside a ninth century woman’s grave in Sweden, the stone inset into the ring bears an inscription that says ‘for Allah’ or ‘to Allah’. While it is already known that the Vikings acquired glass in far flung lands, the artefact bolsters the  theory that the seafaring civilisation did business with Islamic traders. A ring (pictured) made over 1,000 years ago has confirmed contact between the Vikings and the Islamic world because it was unearthed in Sweden but bears an ancient Arabic inscription that asys 'for Allah' or 'to Allah' The ring was discovered during excavations of a Viking trading centre in Birka, Sweden, in the late 1800s, Science News reported. Since then, it has been thought that stone in the ring is violet amethyst, but now experts have revealed it is coloured glass – an exotic material at the time. Researchers at Stockholm University used a scanning electron microscope to determine the material and to clearly reveal ancient Arabic writing called Kufic writing, that reads ‘for Allah or ‘to Allah.’ It is known that Scandinavians traded glass objects from Egypt and Mesopotamia up to 3,400 years ago, so it is entirely possible that the Vikings fetched glass goods from the region instead of waiting for them to make their way north via trade networks. Ancient texts also mention trades taking place between the Vikings and members of the Islamic civilisation, which stretched from the Mediterranean to West Asia, but archaeological evidence is rare. The ring was discovered during excavations of a Viking trading centre in Birka, Sweden (shown by the red marker) which lies west of Stockholm, in the late 1800s but has now been examined under a scanning electron microscope to determine the stone is exotic glass, rather than an amythest . Ancient texts mention trades taking place between the Vikings and members of the Islamic civilisation, which stretched from the Mediterranean to West Asia, but archaeological evidence is rare. An illustration of Vikings unloading goods from a longboat is shown . The study, published in the journal Scanning, says: ‘The ring may… constitute material evidence for direct interactions between Viking Age Scandinavia and the Islamic world. ‘Being the only ring with an Arabic inscription found at a Scandinavian archaeological site, it is a unique object among Swedish Viking Age material.’ Further analysis of the ring showed that it was rarely worn. The inner ring still shows signs of where the silver was filed by a craftsman, meaning that it was probably sold as new before it became a treasured possession of a Viking woman. ‘The ring has been cast in a high-grade silver alloy (94.5/5.5 Ag/Cu) and retains the post-casting marks from the filing done to remove flash and mould lines,’ according to the study. ‘Thus, the ring has rarely been worn, and likely passed from the silversmith to the woman buried at Birka with few owners in between.’ Last year, a Viking sword was discovered in a field in Norway by aman scanning the area with a metal detector. This led experts from the Museum of Natural History and Archaeology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology to excavate the site. They found a grave dating to 950AD that contained the remains of a shield buried with a Viking warrior, as well as a sword bearing an inscription. The boss from a Viking shield (pictured) was recently found to contain Islamic coins in a leather purse. This evidence strengthens the theory that the Vikings traded with Islamic civilisations, or came into contact with the culture in Spain . Incredibly, the shield boss - the round part at the centre of a shield - concealed a leather purse with Islamic coins inside. This evidence strengthens the theory that the Vikings traded with Islamic civilisations, or came into contact with the culture in Spain. Archaeologist Ingrid Ystgaard told ThorNews: ‘We have not managed to find out who owned the sword, but we know that he was a well-travelled man.’ ‘The shield boss has a clear cut mark by an axe or a sword,’ she said, before adding that it is not known if the man died in battle.

The unthinkable possibility of a first-round elimination will become reality if England lose to Bangladesh here on Monday, yet the England captain talked as if nothing has been learnt from three abysmal defeats. The subject of England’s over-reliance on statistics has become the hot topic of a long week of introspection in Adelaide but Morgan does not seem to have noticed, judging by his first answer in Saturday's pre-match interrogation. Ian Bell of England takes a catch during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval . England's Alex Hales takes a catch during an England nets session on Saturday . England know they can not afford a slip-up or even a rainy day as they prepare to face Bangladesh . ‘Having a break has given us time to reflect and the analysis has come through which backs up our feel of what happened during the Sri Lanka game,’ said Morgan. ‘It makes things a lot clearer moving forward. It keeps it simple.’ Well, to put it simply, England were thrashed by Sri Lanka in Wellington by nine wickets with 16 balls remaining, when 309 became not nearly enough. Does it need analysis to tell Morgan that England under-estimated what a winning score would be and then bowled like drains? Also, the key statistics in Gary Ballance’s World Cup are 10, 10, 10 and 6, his scores since being parachuted in to the side at the expense of Ravi Bopara on the eve of England’s first World Cup game against Australia. England warm up during a nets session at the Adelaide Oval where they will meet Bangladesh . Chris Jordan (left) is held back at the Adelaide Oval as he and his team-mates get prepared . Yet unless Morgan was being disingenuous to protect his man yesterday England, who tinkered with their team the day before the tournament, are now perversely going to be stubborn and again ignore the claims of Alex Hales. ‘The decision we made to put Gary at three was a huge one,’ said Morgan. ‘There wasn’t much between him and Alex at the time and it was just a feel we had. It is a big decision to change anyone in the side and it won’t be taken lightly nor quickly.’ No one is doubting that Ballance has a bright future but right now, when England’s need is most acute, he looks rusty and short of the dynamism needed at this tournament. If England really are determined not to pick Hales — and every indication here is that deep down they do not think he is the answer — then perhaps Bopara comes back into the frame with James Taylor returning to three. That would give England an all-important extra bowling option if their preferred tactic of bombarding the opposition with short deliveries from Stuart Broad, Jimmy Anderson, Steven Finn and Chris Woakes does not work again. Ravi Bopara (right) and Eoin Morgan of England look on during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval . Defeat by Bangladesh in Adelaide would pile the pressure on England coach Peter Moores . England have endured some rotten World Cups since they went close in 1992 and must beat Bangladesh . The big two of Broad and Anderson are just as big a worry as Ballance at three. Both have taken just two wickets in this World Cup and their return in tandem for the first time in one-day cricket in two years has not been the bowling panacea England were counting on after losing in Sri Lanka. ‘It’s a difficult one really,’ said Morgan. ‘They are exceptional bowlers but have not been putting the ball consistently in the right areas and haven’t been able to take early wickets.’ England need all their under-performing players to come through now. They should beat Bangladesh — who gained an unexpected point when their game against Australia in Brisbane was rained off — at the Adelaide Oval to keep their World Cup flame just about flickering. However, upsets do happen and Bangladesh have the ammunition to cause one. The simple truth is, at the moment, England do not look good enough to challenge the best teams here. And they don’t need an analyst to tell them that. [Possible prompt] Write a summary about England's World Cup campaign and their chances of progressing to the next round.

Just last week a consumer advocacy group slammed new proposals to reduce online piracy as 'truly frightening' Piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of Game of Thrones . Just last week a consumer advocacy group slammed new proposals to reduce online piracy as 'truly frightening', as its revealed they could expose Australian internet users to unlimited damages payout to Hollywood studios. Under the new Copyright Notice Scheme Industry Code, anyone with an internet connection could potentially face legal threats from Hollywood studios for illegally downloading movies, TV shows, and music. Consumer group Choice labelled the plan, which was compiled by Australia's largest internet service providers (ISP's) at the request of the federal government, as 'medieval' and said it 'reads like a horror movie script'. The scheme could come into affect as soon as September this year. Under the proposed code, a three-strikes system would be introduced for illegal downloads. Customers suspected of illegally downloading content will be sent a series of notices from their ISP's - a warning, an 'education' notice, and a final notice. 'The code means that anyone with an internet connection could be under threat from legal action. Often consumers share with flatmates, partners, or family, which means that even those who don't download illegally could be taken to court,' Ms Turner told Daily Mail Australia. Foxtel has exclusive rights to the fantasy series leading to criticism by consumer groups . 55% of Australians who downloaded content illegally, including Breaking Bad spin-off Better Call Saul (above)  said it was because of a lack of access . The Communications Alliance, the industry body backing the proposed code, released a statement last week emphasising the 'public education' elements of the code, but noted that the scheme did provide a process of 'facilitated preliminary discovery'. In Australia, piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of Game of Thrones. Unlike in New Zealand, Australia has no limit to fines under the Copyright Act, and it is up to the judge's discretion as to what the consumer is fined. Choice has been vocal about providing consumers with a greater range of legal options to download the content they are seeking so that they don't resort to illegal content. 'We did a survey last year which found that a third of Australians download illegally, and more watch the illegal content,' said Ms Turner. 'When we asked people the reason they downloaded, 55% said it was because of a lack of access, and that they had first tried to obtain the content through legal sources,' she said. Ms Turner said that 55% of those that downloaded illegally had tried to obtain content through legal sources . 'Consumers find it very frustrating when they know the content is online, but that they are blocked from accessing it. It makes very little sense to them.' The code indicates that rights holders need to be working towards initiatives which 'include continuing efforts of Rights Holders to ensure timely and ready availability to Australian consumers of lawful content alternatives.' However, Ms Turner said that while it was fantastic to see new streaming service such as Stan available in Australia, the country was still very behind the kind of access others around the world enjoyed. Choice is calling on Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull to intervene and ensure proper protection for consumers under the code, and have launched a campaign urging him to take responsibility for the internet policy.

Findings from a new US study underline the need to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, it is claimed. More than 3 million Britons are diagnosed with diabetes and nine out of ten have type 2 which occurs when the body gradually loses the ability to process blood sugar. Researchers  looked at the number of antibiotic prescriptions given to 200,000 diabetics a year before they were diagnosed, and found those given at least two courses had a higher chance of getting the condition . Type 2 is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as being overweight or obese, leading a sedentary lifestyle and eating an unhealthy diet. Researchers from the Departments of Gastroenterology and Medical Oncology at the University of Pennsylvania carried out the investigation. They looked at the number of antibiotic prescriptions given to more than 200,000 diabetics in the UK at least one year before they were diagnosed with the disease, and compared this to the number given to 800,000 non-diabetic patients of the same age and sex. They found that patients prescribed at least two courses of penicillins, cephalosporines, quinolones and macrolides were at higher risk of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The risk increased with the number of antibiotic courses prescribed, says a report in the European Journal of Endocrinology (must credit). More than 3million Britons have diabetes and nine out of ten have type 2 which occurs when the body loses the ability to process blood sugar . Patients prescribed 2-5 courses of penicillins – used for a variety of infections - increased their risk of diabetes by 8 per cent. The risk increased by 23 per cent for those having more than five courses of penicillins. Patients having 2-5 courses of quinolones, used in respiratory and urinary tract infections, had an increased diabetes risk of 15 per cent, which rose 37 per cent for those having more than five courses. The risk was calculated after adjusting for other risk factors such as obesity, smoking history, heart disease and history of infections. Study leader Dr Ben Boursi said ‘Gut bacteria have been suggested to influence the mechanisms behind obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes in both animal and human models. ‘Previous studies have shown that antibiotics can alter the digestive ecosystem.’ senior author Dr Yu-Xiao Yang added: ‘While our study does not show cause and effect, we think changing levels and diversity of gut bacteria could explain the link between antibiotics and diabetes risk.’ There was no increase in risk associated with use of antivirals or anti-fungal medications and the study found little evidence of a link between antibiotic use and the risk of type 1 diabetes. Dr Boursi said ‘Over-prescription of antibiotics is already a problem around the world as bacteria become increasingly resistant to their effects. ‘Our findings are important, not only for understanding how diabetes may develop, but as a warning to reduce unnecessary antibiotic treatments that might do more harm than good.’ Prof Jodi Lindsay, Professor of Microbial Pathogenesis, St George’s, University of London, said ‘Patients with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of developing infections, and therefore they are more likely to be prescribed antibiotics to treat those infections. ‘In the year prior to diabetes diagnosis, patients may show some signs of disease and may also have a higher risk of infection, and therefore receive more antibiotics. ‘This is a very large and helpful study linking diabetes with antibiotic consumption in the UK public, but at this stage we don’t know which is the chicken and which is the egg. ‘The idea that antibiotics might contribute to diabetes development might be important and more research needs to be done.’ [Possible prompt] Write a summary about repeated use of some types of antibiotic raising the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, according to researchers.", "chosen": "What is the main finding of the study mentioned in the article?", "rejected": "What is an appropriate title for this article?"}

The 'fantastic' underground parking space is located in Kingston House in Kensington, one of the most affluent areas of London. Britain's most expensive car parking space, in Kensington, London, has been put on the market for £480,000 . The 'fantastic' underground parking space, which is a triple bay, is located in Kingston House (pictured) A resident's parking permit in Kensington and Chelsea, where the car parking space is located, typically costs up to £207 per year depending on the car's carbon dioxide emissions . Described as 'spacious', the triple parking bay comes with 24-hour security, a valet service and extensive state-of-the-art CCTV. There is also a complex ventilation system which ensures the regular flow of clean and extraction of carbon monoxide emissions. The parking space has been put on the market with Foxtons for £480,000. With stamp duty, the buyer will end up paying a total of £494,000 - three times the price of the average home in England and Wales and the same price as a pretty cottage in the Cotswolds. With the same money, you could also buy three plush Ferrari 458s, 50 new Ford Fiestas or a lavish superyacht. On top of this, the purchaser will also have to pay an additional £1,500 per year service charge. The bay is one of two triple spaces currently for sale in the underground car park. The other one costs £390,000. There is also a single space for £132,000. Paul Wallace, who runs the YouTube channel Supercars of London, believes it is unfortunately a price to pay for keeping your cars safe. The same amount could buy you this quaint country cottage in Costwolds village Bourton-on-the-Hill . It could also buy you this lavish 16th century castle, which has six bedrooms, in By Chryston, Glasgow . He said: 'You might think the super wealthy residents of Central London would have unlimited secure parking spaces, but it is becoming more apparent that this is not the case. 'There are lots of £200,000 supercars left on the side of the roads overnight, which exposes the cars to having wing mirrors clipped, rain and pollution on paintwork and even worse. '£480,000 is an very excessive cost to keep your car safe at night, but it's relatively essential with potential vandals.' The Kingston House car park, on Prince's Gate, can house a maximum of 144 cars. As part of a multi-million pound renovation, engineers installed a state of the art ventilation and fume extraction system which is designed to 'ensure the regular flow of clean air throughout the car park and the extraction of harmful carbon monoxide emissions'. The £480,000 - which would also have stamp duty added on -  could also buy you this luxury yacht . A prospective buyer could also swap the parking space for three of these cars, a Ferrari 458 . On its website, Kingston House Private Parking described the car park as a '5 star parking facility deserving of our discerning clients'. Henry Pryor, a property expert, described the £480,000 triple car parking spot as a 'reasonable expenditure' for the right person. He said: 'Secure parking in central London is particularly valuable at the moment with homeowners keener than usual for serviced and underground spaces in the light of recent keyless entry car crimes. 'In Kensington and Chelsea it costs £4 per hour to park, for 10-12 hours a day, most days of the year.

Alonso, who races for McLaren-Honda, crashed at 150mph on February 22 during pre-season testing and was rushed to hospital where he spent three days under observation. Asked by doctors who he was, what sort of work he was in and what he wanted to be in the future, he replied: 'I'm Fernando, I drive go karts and I want to be a Formula 1 driver,' it is claimed. Scroll down for video . Formula 1 ace Fernando Alonso waves to supporters as he leaves hospital on February 25 . McLaren-Honda claimed doctors found Alonso to be 'asymptomatic' with 'no evidence whatsoever of any injury'. Here he is pictured in hospital following the accident . Two days ago McLaren-Honda stated doctors had found the 33-year-old to be 'asymptomatic', with 'no evidence whatsoever of any injury' and 'entirely healthy from neurological and cardiac perspectives'. However, worrying reports in Spain's El Pais newspaper suggest his concussion was so severe when doctors asked him questions he thought it was 1995 and aged 13. The paper also claimed he could not remember his F1 debut in 2001, the victories of his beloved Real Madrid or his two world championship titles and it took him a week to recover these memories. Meanwhile, McLaren-Honda confirmed two days ago that he would be sitting out the start of the F1 season on doctors' advice. A spokesperson said: 'His doctors have advised that he should not compete in the imminent Australian Grand Prix meeting, which will take place on March 13th, 14th and 15th. 'Fernando has understood and accepted that advice, and the two McLaren-Honda cars will therefore be driven in Australia by Fernando’s team-mate Jenson Button and the team’s test and reserve driver Kevin Magnussen.' McLaren did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment. The Spaniard was then airlifted by helicopter to hospital following the crash, which happened during the final day of the Formula One pre-season test at the Circuit de Barcelona Catalunya. At the time, McLaren said the two-time former world champion was 'conscious and able to speak' while receiving first aid at the circuit's medical centre, but had been taken to hospital for 'precautionary checks'. After several hours of tests and observation, the team later added that Alonso was 'uninjured' but had suffered concussion in the accident, which took place just before turn four on the track.

Teenage years: Fernando Alonso, pictured here in 2001 at the age of 16, had forgotten 20 years of his life after being concussed in a pre-season crash last month . Although he was technically given a clean bill of health after sustaining concussion in the heavy crash, the fear of 'second-impact syndrome' forced him out of the start of the racing season. The term refers to a second concussion occurring when the effects of the first are still subsiding, potentially resulting in severe brain injuries, or even death. Although the timespan between the accident and Alonso returning to the car for first practice in Melbourne on March 13 would appear to be sufficient, he is not prepared to take any risks. Via his Twitter account, he said: 'It will be tough not to be in Australia, but I understand the recommendations. A second impact in less than 21 days 'NO' #countdownMalaysia.' Alonso tweeted his disappointment at not being able to make the season-opening F1 grand prix in Australia . For the Albert Park event his seat will be occupied by Kevin Magnussen, demoted to reserve driver following the Spaniard's arrival after a full season with the team in 2014. A thrilled Magnussen, who will partner Jenson Button in Melbourne, tweeted: 'Shame about the circumstances but still I'm so excited to be racing in Melbourne. Can't wait!!' Alonso rejoined McLaren this season after a disappointing fifth and final campaign with Ferrari. He won back-to-back world titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006 before spending one season at McLaren in 2007. Alonso has 32 career grand prix victories, the last of which came at Montmelo in 2013.

Chemists claim they may have finally solved the riddle of how life first got going on Earth. They have found it is possible to create the three main molecular building blocks of life - DNA, proteins and lipids - from hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and ultraviolet light. Meteorite impacts, like the one in the illustration above, may have triggered the creation of hydrogen cyanide that scientists have found can create the three basic building blocks of light in reactions powered by sunlight . Their findings suggest that the basic components for biological cells could have all occurred simultaneously in primordial ponds and streams, coming together to form the first cells. This suggests that life may well have first emerged here on Earth - out of a toxic soup of poisonous gas - rather than being carried to our planet by a comet or meteorite from outer space. RNA stands for ribonucleic acid. It is one of three important molecules that are essential for all known forms of life - as well as proteins and lipids. RNA is formed from strings of nucleic acids, the same building blocks that create DNA. Genetic information in a cell flows from DNA through RNA to proteins. DNA is considered the 'blueprint' of the cell and RNA is what helps translate it. Some life, like viruses, only use RNA and it is thought that some of the earliest organisms on Earth used this molecule. Proteins are considered to be the workhorses of the cell built up from strings of amino acids. These carry out the biochemical reactions that take place in the cell and make life tick. Lipids are fatty molecules that line up in formation that can create protective vesicles. They form the membrane 'walls' of every living cell and give them structure. They are also essential for sending signals out of the cell. But the researchers behind the new study say that meteorite impacts probably still played a key role in giving life a first leg up on the ladder towards existence. They claim that meteorite impacts around four billion years ago - known as the Late Heavy Bombardment - could have carried with them carbon rich material that reacted with nitrogen in the air to produce an abundance of hydrogen cyanide. This poisonous gas could then have dissolved in water and undergone a series of chemical reactions, along with hydrogen sulphide, driven by ultraviolet light. Professor John Sutherland, a chemist at the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge who led the study said: 'Although it necessarily has to be painted with broad brushstrokes, the picture that emerges is of an overall reaction network developing over time in separate streams and pools, according to a dynamic flow chemistry scheme. 'The various products would be synthesized by subtle variations in the flow-chemistry history of the streams and the order in which they merged or ran into pools. 'Although the overall scheme would not involve all the steps of the reaction network taking place simultaneously in ‘one pot’, the various products would end up mixed together in pools.' Scientists have long believed that the building blocks for life first began occurring one after another although the debate for which came first has been controversial. Meteorite fragments and bedrock in craters like this one could have reacted with hydrogen cyanide dissolved in pools of water to create salts that react with heat and ultraviolet light to create RNA, lipids and amino acids . The researchers behind the new paper propose a number of geochemical steps shown above that could have seen hydrogen cyanide start a series of reactions that led to the creation of amino acids, nucleic acids and lipids necessary for life. First the hydrogen cyanide is dissoved in water (a) and then reacts with metals to create salts (b). These are left behind by evaporation and then undergo changes due to geothermal heating (c). The resulting molecules are swept away by steams and accumulate in ponds where they react further (d). The researchers behind the latest study, which is published in the journal Nature Chemistry, found they could make nucleic acids - a precursor for RNA and DNA - from hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and UVlight. They also found the same basic ingredients could also lead to the creation of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, and lipids which form the protective membranes around biological cells. The conditions necessary to create all of these were found to be the same, meaning a single set of chemical reactions could have given rise to life's basic building blocks simultaneously. Professor Sutherland and his colleagues argue that the early Earth would have been a favourable setting for these reactions. Hydrogen sulphide is thrown out in volcanic eruptions like the one above and may have been a vital ingredient in the formation of the first biological building blocks needed to create living cells, according to new research . One of the great mysteries shrouding the origins of life on Earth is how complex organisms began to take shape. Theory should hold that 'short' fragments of genetic material would have reproduced in abundance, leaving longer strands - and thus complex life - behind. But new research has revealed that longer strands may have thrived in volcanic 'pores' on the young Earth - ultimately allowing life to evolve to the complexity we see today. The research was carried out by a team from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich and published in the journal Nature. They found that water-filled micropores in hot rocks may have acted as the nurseries in which life on Earth began. One crucial precondition for the origin of life is that comparatively simple biomolecules must have had opportunities to form more complex structures. These, in turn, had to be capable of reproducing themselves, storing genetic information in a chemically stable form. Creating longer strands of RNA to store this genetic information would have been essential - but it simply wouldn't have been possible in most conditions on Earth. But LMU physicists led by Dr Dieter Braun showed experimentally that pore systems on the seafloor that were heated by volcanic activity, namely hydrothermal vents, could have served as reaction chambers for this RNA. Hydrogen cyanide would have formed in large amounts due to the bombardment of comets raining down on the Earth a few hundred million years after it formed. Hydrogen sulphide was also thought to be common on the early Earth - thrown out by volcanic eruptions - while the sun would have provided more than enough ultraviolet light. Metal containing minerals that could have catalysed the reactions were also abundant while metal meteorites could also have caused the formation of other crucial elements like phosphate. In their paper, the scientists set out a series of geochemical scenarios that would have led the reactions in different directions to produce each of the necessary building blocks. Evaporation for example could have caused salts for form that could have then been washed into streams where solar radiation would have driven further chemical reactions. Over time the different products would have been mixed together as streams met and mingled into pools. Jack Szostak, a molecular biologist who studies the origin of life at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and was not involved in the study, told the journal Science: 'This is a very important paper. 'It proposes for the first time a scenario by which almost all of the essential building blocks for life could be assembled in one geological setting.'

And yet, if this amazing ossuary was false, then it was one of the greatest forgeries in history. Underlying the question of the authenticity of the ossuary is an even bigger theological problem: whether or not Jesus actually had any brothers. Though the debate's origins are ancient, the answer still divides Catholics and Protestants. For Catholics, Mary, Joseph and Jesus are a family unit unto themselves. Yet Catholic theology also holds that Jesus was God's son, born of the virgin -- and that Mary did not give birth to other children, divine or otherwise. 'Finding Jesus': John the Baptist Q&A . So who are these \"brothers\" that the Gospel of Mark mentions? The Rev. James Martin, author of the book \"Jesus: A Pilgrimage,\" calls the relationship between James and Jesus \"very complicated.\" \"He's called clearly the brother of the Lord, and the Greek uses the common word for brother,\" Martin says. But Catholics also believe in Mary's perpetual virginity, so Martin surmises that James and the other brothers were Joseph's children from a prior marriage.\"It makes sense that Joseph would have been older and Mary was younger, so I see them in a sense as stepbrothers.\" Other Catholic scholars see James and Jesus  as cousins, an idea that began in the fourth century, when St. Jerome, who translated the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament into Latin, argued the point against the theologian Helvedius, who said Mary and Joseph had other children. 'Finding Jesus': Shroud of Turin Q&A . Jerome countered that these children were instead born to Mary of Clopas, Jesus' aunt. Jerome used his linguistic facility to argue that \"adelphios,\" the Greek word used for Jesus' brothers and sisters, could refer to cousins, as well as to siblings. Protestants, however, see Jesus' family as free of ambiguity, with Mary and Joseph having several children. One of them is Jesus -- but the question then becomes, which one? Ben Witherington III, professor of New Testament Interpretation at Asbury Theological Seminary, offers the Protestant view that Jesus and James were full brothers, with Jesus being the elder. \"The New Testament says nothing about Mary being a perpetual virgin, it says she virginally conceived Jesus, and it certainly implies that she went on to have more children after that, and his brothers and sisters are in fact his brothers and sisters,\" Witherington says. Is Judas in hell? Jesus is presented as the older brother who leaves the family and walks about in Galilee and Judea, has a ministry and leaves James and the other brothers and sisters in charge of the family, according to the scholar. What's more contentious for some Protestants, is the fact that Jesus, as the eldest in the family, essentially forsook his obligation as next-in-line to head the family after Joseph died. Instead he followed his divine destiny, as ordained by his father in heaven. 5 things you didn't know about Jesus . That left James to fill the void. Whatever he was -- brother, step-brother or cousin -- we know that James became important in the early Christian church because of his relation to Jesus. Paul, the apostle who transformed the new religion from a local phenomenon into a movement throughout the Roman Empire, says as much in his letter to the Galatians: . \"Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him 15 days;  but I did not see any other apostle except James the Lord's brother.\" James and Peter and Paul were the prime movers of this new faith, with James the leader of the Jesus followers in Jerusalem until he was martyred in 64 CE, forgiving his killers with his last breath, just as his brother Jesus had done. Given his importance to the early Christian Church, why wouldn't he be connected to his brother, or even stepbrother, on the burial box containing his bones?

The star, 68, has snapped up an entire collection of masks by a British artist which are replicas of his own face. He now plans to add them to an official archive documenting his career. His attention was reportedly drawn to the items by a team he employs to monitor the art world for pieces inspired by his life. Iconic: David Bowie has snapped up an entire collection of masks, pictured left,  by a British artist inspired by his face. Pictured right: Image from Bowie's Aladdin Sane LP cover . Some masks had previously been on sale as part of a Bowie exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum for £125, but speculation is the star paid much more for the ones he purchased. The masks were made from an original cast of the glam rock star’s face taken in the seventies to promote his film The Man who Fell to Earth. After lying unused for several decades, the cast was rediscovered by London-based artist Mark Wardel who began making replicas of Bowie’s face for fans, decorating them with designs including the classic lightning bolt look used on the cover of 1973 album Aladdin Sane. Wardel was recently contacted by Bowie’s agents who said the man himself was interested in purchasing all the others that he had in his collection. He has now bought up a set of six masks for an undisclosed figure. When asked if Bowie paid well for the pieces, Wardel replied: ‘Yep he did.’ The artist revealed: ‘I had a call before Christmas from Bowie’s agent saying the man himself was interested in buying some of my masks. ‘I wondered how he knew I had them but I was told Bowie employs people to keep a look out for people making images or art work of him. Bowie now plans to add the masks to an official archive documenting his career after being alerted to them by a team he employs to monitor the art world for pieces inspired by his life . ‘I was told not to worry as Bowie loves the mask and wants to buy them for his archive. ‘I spent days making two of them and sent them off to New York and got a message back saying Bowie loved them and thought they were gorgeous. He now wants to buy the whole set. ‘Because of Bowie’s interest I have now had to take them off the market.

And unlike the vehicles in Mad Max, it's built to keep drivers comfortable, with leather seats and a DVD player fitted in the cab . Farmers Weekly told MailOnline that GPS steering systems are farmers’ favourite piece of modern farming technology. Steering systems got one third of the total votes out of the top 10 favourite farming tools. They are used to steer tractors in more precise patterns than humans are capable of, resulting in significant savings and improved productivity. GPS provides accurate location information by calculating the distance from at least three satellites and can also be used on farms to analyse soil fertility, Alex Thomasson, professor of biological and agricultural engineering at Texas A&M University wrote in an article for The Conversation. Farmers can use a GPS receiver to collect soil samples from pre-selected parts of fields. They then send the samples off to a lab for analysis, which creates a fertility map of their farm. Farmers can use the map to work out the amount of fertiliser needed for each location, giving their crops the best chance of growing and saving them money. Variable-rate technology (VRT) fertiliser applicators dispense just the right amount of fertiliser in each location, varying the qualities as the farmers go along. Before GPS, it was down to the driver to keep the tractor straight to avoid using too much seed, fertiliser or fuel, but today many farmers have some form of GPS steering, which means overlapping has all but disappeared and straight lines are easy. This has resulted in significant savings and improved productivity, which is why the innovation is a firm favourite with tech-savvy farmers. GPS self-steering systems were voted as being British farmners' favourite piece of modern farming technology in a poll by Farmers Weekly. But not all tractors using the technology are as impressive and inwardly luxurious as this latest model. Despite its rugged appearance, the tractor offers a comfortable ride for drivers. The cab is fitted with climate control and the seat is leather and heated. There is even a DVD player to watch while the tractor follows its pre-set path up and down fields. Only 28 of the machines - which cost up to a quarter of a million pounds each ($373,000) - will be made, and Britain is set to be one of the biggest markets. One East Anglian land-owner said: ‘Years ago a 1,000-acre farm would have employed 40 men - but with a machine like this the same acreage can be farmed by just one man.’ In the film, people travel across an apocalyptic wasteland with few resources in a bid to survive.

However, the tractor features luxuries such as leather seats, for example . For farmers, aerial photographs taken by drones offer a quick and easy way to check on the progress of crops and determine where they may need to replant or direct pesticide applications. Researchers at the University of Illinois are using drones on farms to take aerial photos of crops growing in research plots. Dennis Bowman, a crop science teacher at the university, deliberately made mistakes on one test plot by not applying enough nitrogen fertilizer and is now using drones to see if they can reveal potentially weaker crops. ‘As the crop gets up and going, we'll fly over it and see if we can detect those areas sooner than we could visually from the ground,’ he said. ‘We're also looking at doing some scans over our herbicide studies to see if the drone photography can help us identify where crops are stressed by postemergence herbicide applications.’ Mr Bowman spent two summers as a commercial crop scout and said that walking through tasseling corn in high temperatures is unpleasant. ‘The odds of actually getting to the far end of that field on foot to see what's going on are pretty slim. To get a bird's-eye view of your crop, the drones offer a handy way to do it.’ He is using two quadricopters affixed with a Go-Pro camera and a Canon Powershot SX260 camera with a lens for infrared photography to see if they can spot potential crop trouble. ‘Standard pictures and video taken with drones can tell us a lot. But what we're looking to give us even more information is multispectral cameras that can give us imagery in other wavelengths, such as near-infrared, to help us identify areas of crop stress. ‘It probably isn't going to tell us what the problem is, but it will tell us where problems are so that we can target our scouting in those specific areas and determine what might be occurring.’ Infrared images will help the researchers identify plants in the farm that appear to be absorbing or reflecting light differently - an indication that the plants are under some type of stress, such as pests, disease or nutrient deficiencies. The drones may be used to spot an invasive weed called Palmer amaranth, which is spreading across the Midwest and is becoming increasingly resistant to herbicides to the extent that it could drastically reduce farmers' yield potential in affected fields. ‘Before the soybean rows close, or if we get a different spectrum response from some of these weeds as they break through the canopy, we may see some of those weeds show up in the imagery as well to identify where there are hot spots and problems,’ Mr Bowman said.

An estate agent faces jail after she crashed her BMW into a petrol pump on a garage forecourt while she was more than four times over the drink-driving limit. Tina Knowles was apparently on her mobile phone when she careered into the petrol station and smashed into a large pipe used to release vapour from underground fuel tanks. The garage in Driffield, Yorkshire had to be evacuated over fears the crash could endanger the public, a court heard. In aftermath of the accident, Knowles, 43, remained in the car talking on the phone, slurring her words and ignoring the garage attendant. David Ward, prosecuting, told Beverley Magistrates' Court that forecourt attendant Rebecca Roberts was looking out of her kiosk when she saw Knowles 'shoot across' in her silver BMW Z4. He continued: 'It drove across the forecourt without stopping and collided with a substantial metal vapour release pump opposite the kiosk. 'The female driver appeared to be on a mobile phone at the time. Miss Roberts was initially ignored by the female driver. 'Miss Roberts could smell alcohol on her breath. She was very drunk. She could not talk properly and was slurring her words. 'Miss Roberts said to turn off the petrol pumps immediately for public safety.' The court heard that Knowles was led into the garage's shop as staff took her keys off her and waited for police to arrive. The estate agent 'became emotional' after the police were called, Mr Ward said, adding: 'She started sobbing. She said, \"It's my car. I've f***ed up. I'm an alcoholic.\"' A breath test revealed that she had 152 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of breath - the legal limit is 35. Mr Ward said: 'Police were so concerned about the amount of alcohol she had drunk that they sent her to hospital to check for alcohol poisoning. 'They had never seen anyone drink that much before and get in a car and drive.' Crash: Knowles smashed into a venting pump at this petrol station in Driffield, Yorkshire . Car: The estate agent was driving a silver BMW Z4 similar to this one at the time of the accident . Knowles, from Driffield, pleaded guilty to drink driving and breach of bail after she missed a scheduled court appearance this week because she was in a rehab clinic. The court heard that last year she was spared a driving ban after she was convicted of failing to provide a specimen of breath. Knowles has now been banned from driving ahead of a sentencing hearing next month, which could see her sent to prison. Defending solicitor Rachel Davies said: 'There's clearly a lot of issues in her life. She freely accepts she's an alcoholic and needs help and support.'

Police have arrested a 19-year-old student in connection with a stabbing at Morgan State University that left three football players injured. Police said Wednesday that Carlos Mars has been charged with assault and weapons charges. The stabbing happened Tuesday afternoon when a fight broke out between two groups of students at the Baltimore-based campus. Police say two men were slashed, one across the chest and one in the back, and a third student suffered abrasions. Charging documents show that a witness told investigators that Mars 'repeatedly and aggressively' stabbed another student in the chest during a fight. But Mars told investigators he 'swung his knife around in a wild manner' to keep students away from his friend, who also was involved in the fight. Police say Mars remains in jail. It was the third instance of violence on the Baltimore campus in less than a week. The players were taken to hospitals and their injuries were not considered to be life-threatening, police said. University spokesman Clint Coleman said one of the players was slashed across the chest and another was cut on the arm.

'We expect you as students to take responsibility for your own behavior and actions,' University president David Wilson told those in attendance. Two groups of people got into a fight outside a dining hall on the Morgan State University campus, and some football players were stabbed by someone swinging a knife wildly, police and college officials said . History: Morgan State is the largest historically black university in Maryland and has about 6,000 students . Earlier Tuesday, Wilson sent an email to students that declared 'This is not Morgan!' Kevin Banks, vice president for student affairs, repeated that assertion. 'The stuff you've seen on TV the past few days is not Morgan State University,' Banks said. Wilson also said no text alerts were sent to students immediately after the stabbing because 'the general public was not in imminent danger because this was a fight between known parties and not a random act of violence.' But Freshman Shakia Marine, 20, who did not attend the campus meeting, said she is a little worried about the latest spate of violence. 'My godfather has concerns about me coming here,' Marine said.

A Chinese restaurant in Nairobi,  which barred black customers after 5pm, has been shut down with its owners summoned before authorities . The restaurant's rule was brought into place after a robbery in 2013 and was not meant to cause offence, the owners said. 'We don't admit Africans that we don't know because you never know who is Al-Shabaab and who isn't,' restaurant relations manager Esther Zhao told the Daily Nation. But Otiende Amollo, the Ombudsman, said it was both illegal and unconstitutional to discriminate against an individual on the grounds of their race, gender or ethnicity. He said: 'That amounts to racial and ethnic profiling, which is unconstitutional. 'It has in it the inherent assumption that Africans are inevitably pre-disposed to be robbers.' Residents took to social media to express their anger at being banned from the Chinese using the hashtags #RacistRestaurant, #NoBlacksHere and #TheChineseInvasion.

The American journeyman was handed a 15-year ban after being found to have taken several banned substances, including steroids, in out-of-competition tests carried out in December and January. The severity of the ban for the 29-year-old world No 267 owes itself to Odesnik already having been given a two-year ban when he was found in 2010 by Australian customs officials to be importing vials of human growth hormone at Melbourne Airport. American tennis player Wayne Odesnik has been banned for 15 years after a second doping violation . ‘Goodbye Wayne … good riddance,’ tweeted Murray, who has been among the more vociferous players calling for an extension of anti-doping measures in tennis. Andy Roddick joined in the condemnation of Odesnik who, even before 2010, was deeply unpopular in the locker room. He tweeted: ‘My feelings are that he’s a d*****bag and I hate that he has a US flag to his name when he’s cheating, good riddance.’ Veteran British doubles player Jamie Delgado chimed in: ‘Wayne Odesnik cheats again, what a joke. Get out of the sport mate.’ Murray later beat Adrian Mannarino 6-3, 6-3 at the BNP Paribas Open and will face Spain’s Feliciano Lopez in the quarter-finals. It was Murray’s 496th win, equalling Tim Henman’s record for a British man in the Open Era. After his victory, Murray spoke further on Odesnik's ban. He told the BBC: 'I think it's a good thing for tennis that he's off the tour. Andy Murray tweeted 'bye bye Wayne... good riddance' before his win over Adrian Mannarino in Indian Wells . 'He was given a second chance in a way. He was a cheat so it is good for everyone involved in tennis that he's been dealt with in the right way. 'I think any doping in any sport is very bad. I think it's the job of the sports when cases do come up that they treat them very strictly and in the right way. 'I think [testing] is going in the right direction but I don't think it will ever be perfect.' Odesnik issued a statement maintaining his innocence, claiming he had accidentally ingested substances through taking an over-the-counter supplement, but he has little credit in the bank, especially after being linked to the notorious Biogenesis clinic in Florida two years ago. Tennis has stepped up its drug-testing regime and introduced a biological passport, but many still feel that a wealthy game should allocate more resources. The fact that Odesnik was initially caught this time in December shows the value of more expensive out-of-competition testing compared to the cheaper option of doing it at major tournaments, where it is most expected.

Starting on Monday, staff at the 4,700 cafés across America will have the option to write 'RaceTogether' on cardboard cups, which is the slogan of a Starbucks anti-racism campaign. It is hoped that customers who encounter the slogan on their coffee cup will be inspired to discuss the deeper issues affecting America. Scroll down for video . Campaign: Starbucks boss Howard Schultz has instructed staff to write 'RaceTogether' on cups in an effort to draw customers into a discussion about the state of race relations in America . Talking point: Although Starbucks says that nobody will be forced into a discussion, baristas will attempt to speak to customers about racism in America by writing slogans on their coffee cups . The move is the brainchild of Howard Schultz, 61, the company's boss, who has a track record of speaking out about contentious topics, from gay marriage to gun control. His decision came in response to the escalating racial tension that emerged when grand juries failed to indict white police officers involved in the killings of Michael Brown, 18, in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner, 43, in Staten Island, New York. Last year, Schultz travelled to Starbucks branches in the cities most affected by racial tension, including Los Angeles, St Louis, Chicago, New York, Oakland and Seattle. Mr Schulz met about 2,000 Starbucks staff on the tour, and made contact with the rest of his 200,000 employees - 40 per cent of whom are from ethnic minority backgrounds - via a video address. 'It's an emotional issue,' he said. 'But it is so vitally important to the country.' Last week, the company ran full-page advertisements in the New York Times and USA Today, highlighting race tensions in the country. The page was black, with the words 'shall we overcome?' in the centre, and the company logo at the bottom. The campaign will continue on Friday, when every copy of USA Today will carry an insert about racism, which will also be stocked at branches of Starbucks. Schultz kicked off the campaign last December with a letter that appeared in TIME magazine. 'Last week, one thing became clear: we cannot continue to come to work every day aware of the difficult and painful experiences facing our nation, and not acknowledge them, together, as a company,' he wrote. 'Indeed, despite the raw emotion around the events and their underlying racial issues, we at Starbucks should be willing to talk about them.' Schultz has a track record of using his public profile to highlight issues close to his heart. In 2013, he wrote an open letter requesting customers to leave their guns at home when they visited his stores, even in states where they can be carried legally. 'We believe guns and weapons should not be part of the Starbucks experience,' he said. He also spearheaded a petition to end federal shutdown in the same year, and launched a scheme to boost job creation in the U.S. by selling bracelets in its cafés in 2011. Starbucks is also intending to employ 10,000 former members of the armed forces and their partners over five years. Those who oppose Schultz' views get short shrift. In 2013, an investor said that the company's open support for gay marriage was harming sales. Schultz responded by suggesting that he sell his shares. Schulz will reportedly discuss the Race Together initiative at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, according to Fortune.

Busted: Former member of 'The Real Housewives of Miami' cast Ana Quincoces, 50, (pictured left in her mugshot) was arrested Sunday in Key Largo for driving with a suspended license . TV star: Quincoces (second from left) starred on Season 2 of the Bravo reality TV show in 2012 . The officer wrote in the incident report, cited by Keys Info Net, that he stopped Quincoces because he recognized her from a previous encounter that took place just hours earlier. Police responding to a ‘disturbance call’ on Bahama Avenue confronted Ms Quincoces and informed her that her license had been suspended indefinitely February 9 and 'she was not to drive.' In the early hours of Sunday morning, the same deputy stopped Quincoces outside the Courtyard by Marriot Hotel in Key Largo and demanded to know why she was driving after being explicitly told not to get behind the wheel. The reality TV star was taken to the Plantation Key jail on a misdemeanor charge of driving with a suspended license and released just after 5am on her own recognizance. Quincoces starred on Season 2 of the Bravo reality TV show in 2012 and also made several appearances on the program in 2011 and 2013. Multi-talented: Quincoces, a lawyer by trade, pictured here last October at a charity event in Miami, is also a chef and cookbook author .

On Monday, the 50-year-old 'Real Housewives' alum explained to Keysnet.com that she was staying at a house in Key Largo, which had been listed by a realtor friend, but discovered that it was crawling with cockroaches. Desperate to get away from the critters, she got in her car and set out for home in Coral Gables.

The lawyer-turned-chef chalked up the entire incident to an ‘administrative glitch’ and accused police of being ‘overzealous.’ But according to the celebrity blog Gossip Extra, it all started hours earlier when Ana Quincoces drove down to Key Largo and barged into her ex-boyfriend’s home searching for his new girlfriend. A 911 call placed by the homeowner allegedly picked up a shouting match between Quincoces, her former lover and his new flame.

Quincoces was reportedly heard yelling in the background that she came all this way after a night of drinking and had no intention of going anywhere. The man repeatedly tried to convince Quincoces to leave, at one point telling her: 'I don’t want you here, I’m through with you!' The 911 call concluded with the arrival of deputies. Quincoces’ ex declined to press charges against her, but because the jilted woman appeared drunk, the responding officers seized her license and ordered her not to drive.

Saudi Arabia has launched military operations in neighboring Yemen, where for months Houthi rebels have intensified their violent campaign against the government, the Saudi ambassador to the United States told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. Adel al-Jubeir said the operation consisted of airstrikes on more than one city and in more than one region. Yemen, a longtime stronghold for one of al Qaeda's most dangerous branches, has been plunged into chaos since the Houthi rebels began seizing control of the capital and other areas of the country in recent months. The unrest has led to the withdrawal of U.S. special forces from Yemen, seriously undermining counterterrorism efforts there. How did Yemen get to this place? \"We are determined to protect the legitimate government of Yemen,\" al-Jubeir said. \"Having Yemen fail cannot be option for us or for our coalition partners.\" A leading member of the Houthis' political wing, Ansar Allah, said force will be met with force. \"This is a clear aggression and we will respond by a counteraggression,\" Ali Al Imad told CNN Arabic. \"The Saudi move will unite all the people of Yemen against the Saudis and the kingdom will pay the price.\" If the Saudis try to invade with ground troops, he said, they will fail. \"They probably will try to avoid that, but If it happened then they will pay a very high price,\" Imad said. The Saudi airstrikes appear to be targeting military compounds, headquarters and weapons storage areas. Journalist Hakim Almasmari, who is staying in the capital of Sanaa, said hundreds of explosions have caused residents to stay in their homes. \"I do expect the Sanaa of a couple of hours ago to be a different Sanaa in the morning,\" he said. A senior Arab diplomat told CNN that the Gulf Cooperation Council soon will issue a statement that the Yemenis have asked for military assistance and the GCC is prepared to step in. It will be signed by all GCC countries except for Oman. Not all countries will contribute military forces, the source said. Arab and senior administration officials from the United States told CNN that an interagency U.S. coordination team is in Saudi Arabia. The sources said the Saudis have not specified what they want yet, but will likely ask for American air support, satellite imagery, and other intelligence. \"We can help with logistics and intelligence and things like that, but there will be no military intervention by the U.S.,\" a senior administration official said. Al-Jubeir said the United States is not involved in the airstrikes against the Houthis, who are Shiites in a majority Sunni nation. But the coalition includes more than 10 nations, he said, meaning more than the six GCC countries will be involved. Yemen, which has been in turmoil for months, shares a border with southern Saudi Arabia. \"We hope that the wisdom will prevail among the Houthis and they will become part of the political process rather than continue radical approach to try to take over Yemen and destroy it,\" Al-Jubeir said. Earlier Wednesday, rebel forces captured parts of the port city of Aden and a nearby Yemeni air base recently evacuated by U.S. forces, officials in the country said, with one rebel spokesman claiming that Yemen's president fled Aden as his opponents advanced. The rebels late Wednesday morning captured al-Anad air base, an installation that the last Yemen-based contingent of U.S. special operations forces evacuated over the weekend because of the deteriorating security situation in the country, said Mohammed AbdulSalam, a spokesman for the Houthi rebels. The rebel forces -- Houthis and some allies in the Yemeni military -- then advanced on Aden, the nearby port city where President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi had taken refuge for weeks. There were conflicting reports Wednesday about Hadi's whereabouts. But one Houthi spokesman, Mohammed AlBukhaiti, said Hadi left  Aden on a boat with a Saudi diplomatic team as the rebels approached the port city. AlBukhaiti told CNN that Hadi went to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. But a Saudi Arabian source told CNN's Nic Robertson that the President was still in Yemen in the early hours Thursday. Earlier, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters, \"It's pretty clear (Hadi) left voluntarily,\" without saying where Hadi had gone. She clarified that circumstances in Yemen caused him to leave his residence, but that rebels did not expel him. Two senior administration officials said it's unclear if he left Aden. The rebels' advance illustrated the growing power the Houthis have enjoyed since taking over Sanaa in January, and illustrated a further collapse of a government that had been a key U.S. ally in the fight against then Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. For years, Yemen had allowed U.S. drones and special operations forces to stalk AQAP in the country. Now, that arrangement is in tatters, along with any semblance of peace in the Middle Eastern nation. Underscoring rebels' increasing strength, Houthi-commanded Yemeni air force jets on Wednesday dropped bombs on or fired missiles at the presidential palace in Aden for the third time in a week, causing minimal damage and injuring no one, two Hadi aides said. The airstrikes happened before reports of Hadi's departure from Aden emerged. Hadi had been staying at the Aden palace since last month, when he fled the capital, Sanaa, after a Houthi takeover there. The United States \"strongly condemn(s) the recent offensive military actions taken in Yemen that have targeted President Hadi,\" Psaki told reporters Wednesday. The Houthi militants -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- moved into the capital, Sanaa, in September, sparking battles that killed a few hundred people before a ceasefire was called. In January, they surrounded the presidential palace and Hadi resigned and was put under house arrest. But Hadi escaped in February, fleeing to Aden and declaring that he remained the country's leader. The Houthis took control of military forces stationed near Sanaa, including the air force. Some of the forces aligned with the Houthis also are loyal to Hadi's predecessor, former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who resigned in 2012 after months of \"Arab Spring\" protests inspired in part by a 2011 revolution in Egypt. By last week, opposing Yemeni military forces -- those loyal to the Houthis, and those answering to Hadi -- battled in Aden, with Hadi's forces temporarily pushing out the rebels on March 19 after at least 13 people were killed. On Wednesday, with the U.S. forces gone, Houthi-aligned forces took over al-Anad air base, about 40 kilometers from Aden, said AbdulSalam, one of the Houthi spokesmen. The number of casualties, if any, wasn't immediately available. Some Hadi supporters evacuated the base, and Houthi forces arrested some top officials who were there, including Hadi's defense minister, AbdulSalam said. No deaths or injuries were immediately reported in the rebels' subsequent takeover of Aden's airport and the central bank.

Chief Mike Koval said he knows Madison is being watched across the nation since 19-year-old Tony Robinson's death on Friday evening, and he has gone out of his way to avoid what he once called Ferguson's 'missteps.' 'Folks are angry, resentful, mistrustful, disappointed, shocked, chagrined. I get that,' Koval said Saturday. 'People need to tell me squarely how upset they are with the Madison Police Department.' Scroll down for video . Chief Mike Koval said he knows Madison is being watched across the nation since 19-year-old Tony Robinson's death on Friday evening, and he has gone out of his way to avoid what he once called Ferguson's 'missteps' The contrasts with Ferguson are many. While Ferguson police initially gave little information about the shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old, unarmed black man, Koval rushed to the home of Robinson's mother. She didn't want to meet with him, he said, but he talked and prayed with Robinson's grandmother in the driveway for 45 minutes. It took a week for Ferguson to release the name of the officer who shot Brown. Koval announced the name of the officer involved in Madison, Matt Kenny, the day after the shooting. He volunteered to reporters that the officer had been in a previous fatal shooting in 2007, and that he had been cleared of wrongdoing. On the day that Ferguson police named the officer who shot Brown, they also released video showing what they said was Brown robbing a store. Tony Robinson, an unarmed black 19-year-old, was fatally shot Friday, by Matt Kenny, a white police officer, the Madison police chief said Saturday . When Koval was asked about Robinson's past criminal record Saturday, he declined to comment, saying it would be inappropriate to do so a day after the man died. 'We have a police chief who genuinely feels for a family's loss. It should be abundantly clear to anyone following this incident that Madison, Wisconsin, is not Ferguson, Missouri,' said Jim Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, the state's largest police union. But the chief's measured approach hasn't impressed some demonstrators. Koval angered some of them earlier this year with a blog post demanding they stop blaming police for their problems. 'There are no apologies that can repair the loss or deal with the loss of (Robinson),' said Brandi Grayson, an organizer with Young, Gifted and Black, a Madison group that has demonstrated against what it says is mistreatment of blacks by the justice system. 'This was bound to happen. There's nothing the chief can say short of changing the system.' People gather outside the house where Tony Robinson was shot during a rally on Saturday to protest his death . Robinson died on Friday night after Kenny shot him in an apartment during a confrontation. Kenny had responded to a call of a man jumping in and out of traffic. Kenny forced his way into the apartment after hearing what Koval described as a 'disturbance.' The state Justice Department's Division of Criminal Investigation has taken over the investigation under a new state law passed last year that requires an outside agency to lead probes of officer-involved shootings. DOJ spokeswoman Anne Schwartz declined to comment on Sunday. The shooting comes against a backdrop of multiple instances of white police officers killing unarmed black men around the country over the last year. The highest-profile incident was the death of Brown in Ferguson last August. Days of violence ensued, marked by looting, fires, police firing tear gas into a crowd and officers pointing weapons at demonstrators. Another round of riots broke out in November after a grand jury chose not to indict the officer who shot Brown, Darren Wilson. While Robinson's mom didn't want to meet with him, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval talked and prayed with the dead man's grandmother for 45 minutes . Relatives and friends of Tony Robinson exit a gathering of church representatives, community leaders and residents at Fountain of Life Covenant Church, Saturday, in Madison, Wis. Last week the U.S. Justice Department declined to charge Wilson with civil rights violations but issued a scathing report accusing the Ferguson police department of racism and using policing to fund the city's budget. Koval, who is white, took over as Madison's chief in April, replacing retiring black Chief Noble Wray. In September he told the Wisconsin State Journal he believed his department could deal with a racially charged shooting better than Ferguson, saying his agency is more diverse and more invested in the community than Ferguson's 'rent-a-cops.' 'I see in Ferguson a series of missteps and miscues where they're always reacting and, in fact, over-reacting to every set of facts that is thrown in their midst, frankly,' Koval said in the interview. Two months ago, Koval wrote a blog post criticizing Young, Black and Gifted for blaming his officers for 'everything from male pattern baldness to global warming.' The entry came in response to the group staging protests over officer-involved deaths during rush-hour traffic, demanding jail officials release 350 black inmates and imploring police to stay out of black neighborhoods. Koval tried to be diplomatic when asked about the post on Saturday, saying he and the group have agreed to disagree on policing black neighborhoods. Grayson said Koval has had plenty of time to prepare for a racially charged shooting after watching what unfolded in Ferguson. 'He had a perfect response — perfect for white people,' she said.

The trainer said: ‘We were disappointed with his Cheltenham run but he has come back fine.

It is believed that Bell's model was newer . It is illegal to drive a car like the Skyline on US roads unless the vehicle is at least 25 years old, or if it is being driven on a closed track. Investigators say Bell was returning from a race in Wichita when he was caught speeding along I-35 at around 7.30am on March 22, reported the station KSNT. Bell then allegedly led Kansas Highway Patrol troopers and sheriff’s deputies on a chase that took them through three counties. After a 20-minute high-speed pursuit, Bell finally came to a stop at mile marker 176 when his Nissan's massive 2.6 liter turbo-charged engine exploded, allowing officers to take him into custody. Robert Bell was hauled off to a county jail but later released on $100,000 bail. According to RB's Adrenaline Factory’s Facebook page, Bell's business specializes in automotive repair, customizing, car parts and accessories.

It's become a familiar story: Young people give up their futures in Western democratic nations to join the terrorist network establishing a self-declared Islamic state in the Middle East. Last month, three teenage British girls suspected of wanting to join ISIS may have gone to Syria, authorities said. Their fates remain unknown. An estimated 3,400 Westerners have gone to join ISIS in its bloody quest to establish an Islamist state in Iraq and Syria, said Nicholas Rasmussen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center. Analysts and U.S. officials agree: ISIS is skilled at luring Westerners, attracting far greater numbers than al Qaeda.  How is it doing this? ISIS recruits are often young -- sometimes disillusioned teenagers trying to find purpose and make their mark. \"The general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in Syria suggests camaraderie, good morale and purposeful activity, all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism, designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own self-esteem,\" counterterrorism expert Richard Barrett wrote last year in a report called \"Foreign fighters in Syria.\" Fawaz Gerges, professor of Middle East studies at The London School of Economics, put it more bluntly: . \"ISIS provides these deluded young men and women with an adventurous trip.\" Many recruits come from educated, well-to-do backgrounds, like 25-year-old Abu Anwar of Britain. He said he had no problem leaving a comfortable lifestyle to join ISIS. \"I'm from the south of England. I grew up in a middle-class family,\" he told CNN. \"Life was easy back home. I had a life. I had a car. But the thing is, you cannot practice Islam back home. We see all around us evil. We see pedophiles. We see homosexuality. We see crime. We see rape.\" The names: Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West . Some are lured by the possibility of dying as a martyr so they can enjoy a sumptuous afterlife. Others may succumb to more tangible promises. ISIS loyalists are told they will receive gifts from Allah, wrote Aqsa Mahmood, a young British woman who left Scotland to join ISIS and now is an ISIS recruiter. Such gifts include \"a house with free electricity and water provided to you due to the Khilafah (the caliphate or state) and no rent included,\" Mahmood wrote. ISIS' slick propaganda videos resemble trailers for Hollywood action movies. One hourlong video showed a collection of bombings, executions, kidnappings and beheadings. As one roadside bomb blasts a vehicle into the sky, two men in the background of the video chuckle. ISIS now has the most sophisticated propaganda machine of any terrorist organization, said Matthew Olsen, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. \"It turns out timely, high-quality media, and it uses social media to secure a widespread following,\" he said. Even the U.S. State Department admits ISIS' propaganda prowess \"is something we have not seen before.\" \"It's something we need to do a lot more work on,\" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said last month. \"We are seeing 90,000, I think, tweets a day that we're combating.\" \"We are way behind. They are far superior and advanced than we are when it comes to new media technologies,\" Maajid Nawaz, a former jihadi and author of \"Radical: My Journey out of Islamist Extremism,\" told CNN last year.  \"... It is very attractive for angry young Muslims when they see these sorts of videos and they hear language that resonates with them.\" The slick strategy offers a big edge over al Qaeda.  ISIS \"has proven far more adept than core al Qaeda -- or any of al Qaeda's affiliates -- at using new media tools to reach a broader audience,\" Rasmussen said. Recruits are also being lured by ISIS' success in its endeavor to create an Islamic state, analysts say. The intelligence community determined that ISIS' battlefield successes gave it \"some recruitment success,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in September. \"Militant groups across the Muslim world see the success ISIS has had so far in Syria and Iraq and opt to join it -- often leaving behind organizations plagued by infighting,\" CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen wrote in a CNN.com column. \"This is a political cult using religion and a perversion of Islam as the shield,\" said Steve Hassan,  founder of Freedom of Mind, a group dedicated to exposing destructive cults and cult behavior. \"But in fact, it's a systematic effort to create an army of basically tranced-out followers.\" That type of brainwashing is what turned Canadian Damian Clairmont into an ISIS militant, said his mother, Christianne Boudreau. \"It's so easy for them to get to our children, to access our children,\" she said. Clairmont died fighting in Syria last year. While ISIS' recruiting success gets a lot of attention, it is hardly drawing a huge percentage of young Westerners. About 130 Canadian citizens have traveled to the Middle East to join ISIS, Canada's intelligence agency estimated last year. About 1,200 French fighters have joined ISIS as well.  Roughly 600 British nationals are believed to have gone to Iraq and Syria, according to research groups, along with another 600 from Germany. In the United States, National Intelligence Director James Clapper has said 180 Americans have tried to go to fight in Syria. But it's unclear how many of those were attempting to join ISIS. Once foreigners go to Iraq or Syria to join ISIS, their odds of going back to their families can be slim. Video clips of foreign jihadists burning their passports show that many have no interest in returning home. Western leaders acknowledge there's work to do. \"It needs every school, every university, every college, every community to recognize they have a role to play, we all have a role to play in stopping people from having their minds poisoned by this appalling death cult,\" British Prime Minister David Cameron said last year. The U.S. government is trying to step up its efforts to counter ISIS propaganda by beefing up a small State Department agency to make it the heart of the fight against the militants' messaging. \"We're seeing their approaches continue to evolve,\" Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman, told CNN. \"We need to continue to make sure ours are evolving and we're combating it in the most strategic way and using every interagency resource.\" But she acknowledged that the United States still has a lot to do. \"We're really going to pick it up now,\" Psaki said. \"We have new people in charge of the office. And we will see what happens over the coming months.\" Several anti-ISIS efforts are already in place. Some European countries have laws that penalize membership in groups such as ISIS, said Barrett, the counterterrorism expert. And U.S. State Department official Richard Stengel said an anti-ISIS messaging campaign has helped prevent youths from joining. \"They're reading the messages, they're hearing the messages -- not just from us but from the hundreds of Islamic clerics who have said that this is a perversion of Islam, from the hundreds of Islamic scholars who have said the same thing,\" Stengel said in October. But Barrett said some officials might not be doing as much as they think. \"Policymakers often underestimate the impact of what is happening in these closed circles even as they overestimate the impact of their own.\" CNN's Josh Levs, Joshua Berlinger, Paula Newton, Jethro Mullen, Catherine E.

The deadly attack on the prominent Bardo Museum near Tunisia's parliament in the country's capital, Tunis, is the latest instance of an armed assault carried out by gunmen willing to fight to the death, a tactic that has been widely adopted by jihadist terrorists in recent years, including in North Africa. Such attacks mimic the 2008 Mumbai assaults in which 10 gunmen from Pakistan went on a rampage in the massive Indian port city. They took hostages and killed more than 160 people over a three-day period, in an attack that drew  sustained global TV coverage. The gunmen attacked iconic Mumbai targets such as the Taj hotel, which is frequented by Westerners. The Mumbai gunmen embarked on their attack knowing that it was a \"fedayeen\" mission -- meaning \"those who sacrifice themselves\" -- and that they would probably fight to the death. Only one gunman survived. In this week's Tunisia attack, the gunmen took hostages, two gunmen died in the assault, and three survived and are being hunted by the Tunisian government. Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid said the attackers at the Bardo Museum had specifically targeted tourists to hurt the country's economy. This seems a likely outcome of the attack, as tourism is vital to Tunisia's economy, providing 15% of GDP. Tunisia is also the only country where the Arab Spring produced a successful, lasting democratic transition, making it attractive to tourists who are avoiding going to countries like Egypt, which did not weather the Arab Spring as well as Tunisia. Already, some tour companies are canceling excursions to Tunis. In January, in Tunisia's neighbor Libya, the local branch of ISIS mounted a similar attack on the upscale Corinthia Hotel in the capital, Tripoli. Two gunmen, one of them a Tunisian, killed 10 people, including an American. Both gunmen died in the attack. This attack served ISIS' purposes of sowing greater instability in Libya and expunging Western influence from the country, as the hotel was where many foreign businessmen stayed. A senior US official told one of us that the U.S. intelligence community estimates that jihadist terrorist groups such as ISIS now control a twelfth of the landmass of Libya, which is one of the largest countries on the African continent. This is a sobering finding for Tunisia, which had been largely immune from the kinds of terrorist attacks that have recently plagued Libya and other North African countries. While the museum attack in Tunisia and the hotel attack in Libya may help terrorist groups to achieve their strategic goals, more often than not, armed assaults by terrorists against so-called soft targets such as hotels, supermarkets and malls do not achieve much beyond the tactical successes of global news coverage and causing mayhem. In September 2013, Al-Shabaab, the Somali al Qaeda affiliate, killed 67 people in a fedayeen-style armed assault on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya. Four gunmen carried out the attack, which unspooled over a four-day period. The Westgate attack received much global news coverage and was designed to put pressure on the Kenyan government, which had sent troops to Somalia to fight Al-Shabaab. However, a year and a half after the attack on the mall, Al-Shabaab continues to lose territory in Somalia, and the Kenyan military has continued to battle the terrorist group. The plague of Mumbai-style armed assaults by jihadist terrorists is not confined to Africa. In January, Mumbai-style tactics were used in Paris when Cherif and Said Kouachi and Amedy Coulibaly conducted armed assaults on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket over a three-day period. All three gunmen were killed. In a videotape, Coulibaly said ISIS inspired him. The Paris attacks received considerable coverage around the world but had no impact on France's willingness to continue its involvement in coalition airstrikes against ISIS.

At a dinner in Melbourne ahead of the opening grand prix in Australia this weekend, Dennis set the record straight after saying erroneously that Alonso was not concussed in an accident in testing in Barcelona on February 22. Dennis said: ‘It was not the best performance by me. I understand why the press beat me up - for being inaccurate. I wanted to be open and honest. Ron Dennis apologised for saying Fernando Alonso wasn't concussed when he crashed in testing last month . Italian Alonso had an accident during in testing for McLaren in Barcelona on February 22 . ‘I failed. But it is, as always, my objective to try to be as honest as possible in the future. ‘There are complexities about concussion. It is difficult to quantify, and it goes beyond my area of expertise. It is not my decision whether he will race in Malaysia, but as far as I know he will be there. I have every reason to believe he will be. ‘I spoke to Fernando on the way to this dinner. ‘He wants to race in Malaysia. I hope he does, but it is his decision, not mine.’ Alonso, here being wheeled away from the crash site, says he wants to race in the Malaysian Grand Prix . McLaren boss Dennis relayed Alonso's desire to race a fortnight from Sunday and says it's the driver's choice . Meanwhile Formula One’s penchant for chaos was never better demonstrated than in a bizarre court case unfolding just down the road from the Albert Park track that will host Sunday’s race. At issue is whether a Dutch driver called Giedo van der Garde should drive for Sauber. Subject to an appeal in Melbourne on Thursday, he will win that right - a decision that could even mark the end of Sauber’s participation in the sport after 22 years. This pickle came about after Sauber seemingly reneged on a contract that said Van der Garde would race for them this season. They instead hired two drivers, Brazilian Felipe Nasr and Sweden’s Marcus Ericsson, who between them bring £20million to the team. But Van der Garde went to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, clutching his contract. Dutch driver Giedo van der Garde has taken Sauber to court claiming his right to drive for the team . They found in his favour, a ruling that was upheld by the Supreme Court of Victoria here on Wednesday. Sauber decided to appeal, the result of which is expected on Thursday. The team’s lawyers argued that - only days away from this weekend’s race - installing a different driver was an unacceptable safety risk. They said the cars had been fitted to the specifications of Nasr and Ericsson. Rodney Garratt QC told the court that the absence of the correct seatbelt meant Van der Garde could not compete safely given the 210mph speed of the cars and g-forces ‘up to five times their bodyweight’. In truth, Sauber’s argument was melodramatic rubbish. Even if they need to make some late changes, why is it less safe to let Van der Garde drive than Roberto Merhi, who was only named as Manor’s driver on Tuesday? Merhi has never driven the Manor car. Nobody has. It only passed its crash test last week. Sauber's Marcus Ericsson (left) and Filipe Nasr wait to se if they will drive in Melbourne this weekend . And Van Der Garde, 29, was even Sauber’s test driver last year. They know his measurements. No, Sauber cannot afford to drop Nasr, who is backed by Banco do Brasil, or Ericsson, who brings in a sponsorship package worth £10million. Much of the pair’s money has been paid up front. Those backers would not react kindly to being told their man is suddenly out of a job. One solution would be Van der Garde agreeing to receive compensation, but it is said he would prefer to get the drive rather than the money. However, even this is illogical because without Sauber’s two high-paying drivers the whole team could be forced into administration, meaning therefore, he would have nobody to drive for.

The seven-year-old, trained by Tom Dascombe at Owen’s Manor House Stable in Cheshire and ridden by Richard Kingscote, was always close to the pace in the two-mile Dubai Gold Cup and quickened to beat Star Empire by a decisive three and a half lengths. The victory, the 11th of Brown Panther’s career, secured a first prize of £384,000, by far the biggest Owen has ever won in his racing venture. Brown Panther had a convincing victory for co-owner Michael Owen at the Dubai Gold Cup . Former England striker Owen watches on at Meydan Racecourse on Saturday in Dubai . Owen, who won the 2014 Irish St Leger with Brown Panther, said: ‘He is the horse of a lifetime and a superstar in my eyes. That was a tough race – two miles in this heat and he kept on galloping like he did in the final furlong. ‘He is a talented horse but has great courage. I am very proud of him.’ The success was also rewarding for Kingscote. He has had a race against time to get fit after suffering a broken collar bone, snapped arm, broke wrist and elbow plus punctured lungs in a fall. There was a second win on the Meydan card for Europe when Sole Power, trained in Ireland by Eddie Lynam and ridden by Richard Hughes, landed the Al Quoz Sprint. While British jockey William Buick landed the $10m World Cup on Saeed Bin Suroor-trained 14-1 shot Prince Bishop, who beat 2014 Kentucky Derby winner California Chrome. The success for an eight-year-old who has never won at group one level in Europe and was running in his fourth World Cup was another surprise result in the race. It again showed the Dubai World Cup may be the richest race on the globe but it is of questionable quality. Another former England striker Peter Crouch was also in Dubai with his wife Abbey Clancy . Owen is pictured being questioned by the media after victory for his horse Brown Panther . Meanwhile, owner Marwan Koukash continued his good run of sporting form when 12-1 shot Gabrial, trained by Richard Fahey and 22nd winner of the year for jockey Tony Hamilton, landed the Betway Lincoln Handicap at Doncaster. It was a second win in four years for Gabrial’s team, having landed the 2012 Lincoln with Brae Hill. Flamboyant Koukash is the owner of Super League team Salford Red Devils, who have risen to sixth in the table after a run of three wins in their last five games. Gabrial, who had been unplaced on the Dubai World Cup card 12 months ago, had also run over middle distances last year as Koukash harboured hopes he may become a Melbourne Cup contender. But he showed slick turn of foot over the mile of the Lincoln to beat Mondialiste a neck. Owen and trainer Tom Dascombe pose with Brown Panther after winning the race . Owen is pictured with his family at the Meydan Racecourse after his victory . Fahey said: They raced in a very tight pack and I wasn't sure he was going to get out in time. \"That's the first time I've ever seen him really pin his ears back and have a real go as he's a bit of a character. Tony said he always felt like he was going to win. ‘The only reason he was running over further last year was because after Mount Athos got injured. Marwan wanted a Melbourne Cup horse but he didn't stay.’ Trainer Mark Johnston made a perfect start to the Flat season as his first three runners all won. After Ravenhoe had won the Brocklesby Stakes at Doncaster, the traditional curtain-raiser to the Turf season, Johnston-trained Rah Rah won at Kempton and Buratino at Chelmsford.

Champions for the last three season, Celtic earned £12.6million for reaching the group stage and winning one of their six matches in 2013/14. The same performance next season would bring in at least £16m under the new figures announced by Europe’s governing body — and that does not include ticket sales. Confirming the cash ‘cycle’ for the next three years, UEFA will also seek to narrow the gap between the cash available to Champions League and Europa League clubs. A Scottish club participating in the group stage of the junior competition now stands to make in excess of £4m. Significantly, however, the three Scottish clubs that enter the Europa League qualifiers will now cover their costs via a solidarity payment of £150,000 – even if they crash out at the first hurdle. Celtic failed to make the Champions League this season, crashing out to Maribor in the qualifiers . Craig Gordon saves against Inter Milan in the last 32 Europa League clash at the San Siro . Celtic line up against Inter  but the Parkhead club will be greedy for the Champions League rewards . Yet, the Europa League remains very much the lesser of UEFA’s tournaments and Ronny Deila, who failed to navigate Celtic to the Champions League this season, will now come under increasing pressure to deliver qualification – and bigger rewards - this summer. Currently top of the league table and chasing four-in-a-row, the Parkhead side can expect to make over £10m if they retain their title and reach next season’s group stage – even if they fail to win a point - an increase from £6.4m. Broadcasting pool revenues will also rise while the prize for a win will increasing to £1.1m and a draw will bring in £362,000. The rewards for reaching the last 16 – as Celtic did most recently in 2012 – will now leap by a whopping £4m. The biggest winners – as always – will be the English Premier League clubs with their huge broadcasting pool. If an English side were to win next season’s Champions League, they would earn around £74m from central UEFA funds alone. Yet what is good for the elite — and what is good for Celtic — is not necessarily good for Scottish football. Most – outwith Aberdeen - assume the Parkhead side will retain their title at the end of this campaign and will have another crack at the Euro elite. Becoming champions of Scotland is no guarantee of Champions League participation, of course, yet the prospect of a £16m-£20m windfall is a strong incentive to get it right this time. For Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell, it’s an imperative. The fear is that more UEFA cash only widens the gap between the aristos and the proletariat. Not only in Europe, but in countries like Scotland where more European money allows Celtic to lord it while the others eat cake. Giorgios Samaras scores in the Nou Camp for Celtic in their 6-1 loss in the 2013 group stages . Celtic enjoyed a glamour tie against AC Milan in the group stages of the 2013 Champions League instalment . UEFA said the changes are a bid to address this, to narrow the gap between the elite competition and the Europa League — the level SPFL clubs realistically aspire to — with general secretary Gianni Infantino insisting: ‘UEFA is really pleased that the new distribution system not only provides for a substantial rise in monies received by clubs participating in the Champions League and Europa League but also strengthens UEFA’s solidarity principle, namely ensuring an even more substantial increase in solidarity payments to clubs. ‘In this way, the new system provides a better deal for everyone, especially those clubs which did not qualify to the group stage of either of the two UEFA club competitions. This is a perfect example of the proper implementation of the solidarity principle which forms an essential part of UEFA’s key values.’ For every pound UEFA give to clubs in the Europa League currently Champions League clubs receive £4.30. From next season that ratio will narrow. Crucially, where clubs like Aberdeen, Inverness, St Johnstone or Dundee United are concerned, there will also be the new solidarity payments for those who crash out of the Europa League at the qualifying stage. This has long been the norm for Scottish clubs, their pain heightened by the cost of flying to far-flung remote outposts in Russia, Belarus or Moldova. Potentially very good for Celtic, then, UEFA's announcement should also make European football more appealing and rewarding to those further down the food chain. Charles Barnett, partner of the Sports Group of BDO, told Sportsmail: ‘What UEFA are saying is that from next season the revenues from the two competitions will be put into one pot and distributed to all the clubs participating. ‘So there is more money going to the Europa League and, let’s be honest, when you are thinking about Scottish clubs now that’s what you are really talking about. ‘There is more money now coming into the Europa League and more potentially available to Scotland’s participants via solidarity payments if they don’t make it to the group stage. ‘In the Champions League, which might affect Celtic, they are going up 60 per cent. ‘But more pertinent to Scotland is the fact that solidarity payments for failing to reach the Europa League will be higher. ‘What that should ensure is an end to the scenario where Scottish teams knocked out in the early qualifying rounds of the Europa League lose money when they are sent to the furthest corner of Eastern Europe. ‘Some Scottish clubs like Motherwell have lost money spending fortunes chartering planes. ‘To make £150,000 just for getting knocked out in the first qualifier plus revenue from the home tie should cover the costs of the away leg.’ That covering the costs of defeat has become a Scots priority is mildly depressing. Yet Celtic used the Europa League group stage as a parachute after Champions League failure last season. And, as Barnett explained: ‘The group stage of the Europa League will also offer a substantial increase of 65 per cent. Participation could see clubs make £4m now.’ For Rangers, much of this will be a source of anguish. With a stated goal of competing with Celtic as soon as possible, the gap becomes more and more difficult to bridge every year their rivals win the Scottish title and have another crack at the Champions League. On a day they announced more financial losses, the Ibrox board – and others around the country - can see just how difficult it will be to challenge the Parkhead side as the country’s dominant force. Barnett argues differently, however, and added: ‘Celtic could make £3m to £4m for reaching the group stage and for a club like Celtic, playing in Scotland, that is big money. ‘But that barely pays for another striker, never mind his wages. It could affect competition if they were winning the league and qualifying season after season after season, but will that really destroy competition? I’m not sure. ‘It’s good to see, but I’m not sure it will widen the gulf in Scottish football. ‘If anything, we will see other Scottish clubs earn more cash via the Europa League and, therefore, the teams finishing second, third and fourth in the SPFL Premiership have more opportunity to earn more money. ‘We are talking about more money being made available to clubs that don’t make it into any competition.’ [Possible prompt] Write a summary about the confirmation of large increases in cash sums offered to Scottish clubs for reaching the group stage of the Champions League and winning one of their six matches.

It also heard how students were reportedly acting drunk and slurring their words. Head teacher Jonathan Harrison said in evidence that none of the students had been given permission by him to drink alcohol and none of their parents had consented. She was one of three boarding house staff who took the group of 27 teenagers to the Balti Stan Indian restaurant in Clayton-le-Moors for a meal.  But Mrs Hall told the hearing it was not her responsibility to secure permission from the parents of the group of 15 to 18 year-olds, and was instead the responsibility of her superior . Mrs Hall said it was the responsibility of her superior, boarding house manager, Deborah Richards, to secure the correct permissions. She added that Mrs Richards had said a glass of wine, paid for by the school, would be permitted. Mr Harrison, who represented the school at the tribunal, said that Mrs Hall had failed in her safeguarding duties and was guilty of gross misconduct by allowing students to get drunk. He also said that her actions placed the children in danger and the school could have been closed down as a result. Following the incident on Friday, May 16, 2014, Mrs Richards resigned her position and told the headteacher that she accepted full responsibility. Mrs Hall and her colleague Carol Cradock were suspended and attended an internal disciplinary hearing after which they were both dismissed. Mrs Hall, who lives in Clitheroe, appealed the decision but was unsuccessful. The mother-of-two and grandmother-of-one, who had worked at the school for more than 10 years, said that making sure that parental permission for school trips was secured was not her responsibility. The hearing was shown a series of pictures allegedly showing students from the school (pictured) with alcohol and heard that one boy drank a glass of wine and three pints of lager, and that he bought a Jack Daniels with Coke for another student. She also told the hearing that she did not see any student drinking more than a glass of wine or a pint of lager. Mr Harrison told the tribunal: 'She still can't accept that she did anything wrong and I think it's appalling. 'She brought the school into disrepute. She was in breach of the trust of the school and the parents and her conduct could have led to a serious injury to a student who, under the influence of alcohol, could have wandered out of the restaurant and into the path of a car which could have closed the school down. 'I find it impossible that she has not accepted any wrong doing.' Mrs Hall said: 'Mrs Richards rang me up afterwards and told me that she felt awful that we were going to lose our jobs because she had not done her job correctly. 'No student was drunk at all and we made sure of that at the end of the night. 'During my whole time at the school I had never seen a risk assessment and it was not part of my role. 'I would not have permitted alcohol at all if I had organised the trip but my boss said that it was ok and I had no reason not to trust her.' Citizen's Advice Bureau lawyer Angela Cuncliffe, who represented Mrs Hall, said: 'My client seems to have been made a scapegoat. 'She has lost a job she loved, her good name and quite a bit of money.' Judgement was reserved by Judge Rebecca Howard and is expected to be given in the next four weeks. Following the hearing Mr Harrison said: 'Sometimes we have to make very difficult decisions when looking to protect the welfare and needs of children.' A headline on an earlier version of this article said that teachers were present when some pupils drank alcohol at a restaurant. In fact, it was school boarding house staff who were supervising the pupils when the incident in question took place. We are happy to clarify this.

No doubt there were similar misgivings at UEFA when Serbia were paired with Albania in the 2016 European Championship qualifiers.

Not that his talents stop there. While most children of his age can only count to five, he has taught himself how to count to ten in four languages – English, Spanish, Russian and Japanese – and learnt his 14 times table. In fact he has an IQ of 145 and is already close to qualifying for Mensa. Tests found he had a reading and spelling age of eight and one expert was amazed at how he could converse like an adult. Michael has never had any formal tutoring and instead started to teach himself numbers and words on his mother’s iPad. He quickly learnt how to read eight-letter words and now corrects mother Emma, 39, if she misreads his bedtime story book. Yet his family say he also loves riding his bike and splashing in puddles like any other young boy. Mother-of-two Emma, a postal worker from Yate, Bristol, said: ‘We don’t push him because we are content to let him be himself – but he just teaches himself. Michael can read to himself and experts said his scores for logical thinking 'hit the ceiling' when tested . ‘He is quite fascinated by numbers, and also loves big words. ‘His English is very good, but he is like a sponge and his retention is brilliant.’ Emma and husband Anthony, 33, a chef, first noticed Michael’s talent when he was 18 months old and started to learn from educational games on the iPad. But soon he was asking questions his family couldn’t answer. Michael’s grandmother Jenny Greenwood took him to a specialist in Birmingham and tests found he had a reading and spelling age of eight – and an IQ of 145. The UK average is 104. She said: ‘In the last few weeks he has been obsessed with the planets, learning all the names and where they are.’ Michael’s parents have not submitted him for Mensa membership because they feel he is too young, although the youngest-ever member was just two years and four months-old. Membership of the society is reserved for those with an IQ in the top 2 per cent of the population, around 148. IQ can change over time but most will not change by more than a few points. The score will usually stay the same as it is a measure of ability rather than knowledge. Dr Peter Congdon, who performed intelligence tests on Michael, said he was ‘in the very superior range’ and should jump a year at school so he is not held back. He said: ‘He is outstanding, there is no doubt about it.’ The three-year-old can spell eight word letters on his own, spelling words he has never seen come across . As well as doing his times tables and learning several languages, Michael likes doing 'normal' things for his age like splashing in puddles. The youngster (pictured) has taught himself by using his mother's iPad . Mensa was founded in England in 1946 by Roland Berrill, a barrister, and Dr Lance Ware, a scientist and lawyer. The society welcomes people from all backgrounds who have an IQ is in the top two per cent of the population. Albert Einstein apparently had an IQ of 160, while former US presidents Abraham Lincoln, Benjamin Franklin and Bill Clinton also racked up very high IQs - mustering 128, 160 and 137 respectively.

Jaguar this week launched its new, second-generation XF compact sports saloon with a high-wire drive over water on cables just an inch thick. In a stunt worthy of the latest Bond film Spectre — for which the firm is supplying many of the cars — the XF was revealed in a dramatic stunt in the heart of London's Docklands. High over the Royal Dock in Canary Wharf, stuntman Jim Dowdell — a veteran of the Bond, Bourne and Indiana Jones films — drove the car 240 metres across wires to demonstrate the car's lightweight aluminium construction and agility. Don't look down! Jaguar's new XF seen crossing London's Royal Dock by high wire this week . Excitement aside, Jaguar's XF sport saloon promises 'business class' levels of comfort and refinement with a new generation of frugal engines. It's being built at Jaguar Land Rover's Castle Bromwich factory in Birmingham alongside the allaluminium F-Type sports car and top-of-the-range XJ limousine. Its official global debut is at the New York motor show on April 1 before going on sale in the autumn from £30,000 to £80,000. Jaguar's XF sport saloon (pictured) promises 'business class' levels of comfort and refinement with a new generation of frugal engines . The new version is 80kg lighter than its closest competitor. This helps it return more than 70 mpg with CO2 emissions of 104g/km. Engines include 163bhp and 180bhp 2-litre Ingenium diesels linked to six-speed manual and eight-speed automatic gearboxes. The manual 163bhp diesel is 'the lightest, most efficient non-hybrid diesel model in its market segment,' says Jaguar. All other engines are eightspeed automatics. There is also a powerful 3-litre 300bhp V6 twinturbo diesel and a 3-litre 380 bhp V6 supercharged petrol engine. The proportions have also been tweaked. While 7mm shorter and 3mm lower than its predecessor, its wheelbase is 51mm longer, meaning more back seat space, legroom and headroom. Jaguar is investing £600 million in its manufacturing capacity in Britain, £400million at its Castle Bromwich plant. Great to see Britain's former 'Motown' — Coventry, once the capital of our motor industry — getting some bumper good news this week. The city that for decades has built the iconic London taxi is to gain a new factory, costing £250million, creating up to 1,000 jobs and building up to 36,000 vehicles a year. Chinese motor giant Geely , which bought the UK firm outright two years ago after holding a stake since 2006, said the state-of the-art research, development and assembly plant for the London Taxi Company will be built in the city of Lady Godiva (and Peeping Tom). It is a tenfold increase on the company's site, which has been home to London taxis for 70 years and heralds the introduction of the next generation electric and ultralow emission London black cab. Coventry's links with China go back a long way after it had the foresight in the early Eighties to twin itself with the Chinese city of Jinan in Shandong province. What the two cities had in common was silk: Jinan is at the end of the Silk Road and Coventry — before the rise of the motor industry — was a centre for the finest silk-working. The Chinese think long-term and have an important concept called guanxi — or social connections — which help smooth business. Coventry was early to establish these vital connections. Looks like it's paying off. April should put a spring in the step of outdoor touring types as order books open for the new generation of Audi's epic seven-seat luxury sport utility vehicle the Q7.

In fact, at Coventry City, the midfielder found the experience of being an inferior player to a manager in his early 40s about as palatable as Strachan’s famed longevity-fuelling concoction of porridge, bananas and seaweed. If O’Neill’s injury-scarred spell at Highfield Road was not the most notable of an otherwise successful career, the Northern Ireland manager retains a high regard for his Scotland counterpart and hopes the pair can soon share success in the international arena. Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill has been preparing his side to face Gordon Strachan's Scotland . Strachan's side will be hoping to go into their Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar on the back of a win . Scotland have not qualified for a major tournament since France 98, while Northern Ireland have not been seen at a Finals since the days when Brazil’s Josimar rocketed one of the all-time great World Cup goals past Pat Jennings. But on the road to France 2016, Scotland are third in Group D, while Northern Ireland are second in Group F. As the two nations face off in a friendly at Hampden, O’Neill hopes both men can lead their respective countries out of the international wilderness. ‘I played under Gordon at Coventry — it’s always a concern when the manager is a better player than you,’ quipped the 45-year-old former Dundee United and Hibs midfielder. ‘Other than that it was fine. It was a bit unfortunate that injuries thwarted my opportunity at Coventry but it was evident back then what type of manager Gordon was going to be. ‘He had the ability to motivate and to invigorate. He knew how to get players to respond to him. So it doesn’t surprise me how well he has done with Scotland. He was a great appointment and exactly what Scotland needed at that time. Scotland national team boss Strachan, pictured in 2001, coached O'Neill during his time as Coventry manager . ‘It’s pretty evident the improvement they have made under Gordon. And having played half my career up here, it would be good to see both countries qualify for the Euros. ‘We’ve been nearly 30 years away from a major tournament. Scotland haven’t quite had that to deal with - but I’d love to see both countries do it.’ O’Neill still lives in Edinburgh and remains an avid viewer of the Scottish game, not just because it is home to several Northern Ireland internationals. He believes football in this country is in ruder health than many outsiders – and insiders – perceive amid the often unrelenting negativity that has accompanied the collapse and pained rise of Rangers. ‘I watch Scottish football a lot,’ said O’Neill, who may not risk Aberdeen striker Niall McGinn’s hamstring but could start with two Manchester United centre backs in Jonny Evans and debutant Paddy McNair. ‘There are now potential internationals of the future getting their chance in first-teams in the Premiership and Championship and that can only be good for the Scotland national team. ‘There’s been too much negativity about Scottish football at times, obviously because of what’s gone on at certain clubs. But the game is in a lot healthier state than people give it credit for.’ Manchester United team-mates Jonny Evans and Paddy McNair are expected to start in defence . For Northern Ireland captain Steven Davis, a return to Hampden will bring back fond memories of his last appearance in Mount Florida. Back in March 2011, he scored the opening goal as Rangers beat Celtic 2-1 in extra time to lift the League Cup – the club’s last major trophy before administration then liquidation visited Ibrox and leading players including Davis quit. ‘It will be nice to be back at Hampden,’ said the 30-year-old Southampton midfielder. ‘It holds special memories for me. We had a lot of success there with Rangers but my last game, the League Cup Final, stands out. Celtic were always kind of favourites before we went into any Old Firm game and they had the upper hand before that game. But I scored a goal and we won the cup that day. ‘I was lucky to have four years at Rangers and it was disappointing how it ended. That was the hardest thing to take. But I’ll always look back on it as one of the most important and enjoyable periods in my career. Southampton midfielder Steven Davis, pictured in Janaury 2012, returns to his former stomping ground . ‘It’s a bit of an impossible subject to talk about (leaving) because you’re never going to please everybody with what you say. But the honesty of it is we could only try and make a decision based on what we thoughts was best at the time and you have to live by that.’ As he turns back the clock by returning to Glasgow, however, Davis feels the future is bright now that Ibrox is back in the ownership of ‘Rangers men’ like Dave King and Paul Murray. And the former Rangers captain, who played in the 2008 UEFA Cup Final with the Ibrox side, hopes the hiring of nine-in-a-row idol Stuart McCall can kick-starts a Rangers revival back towards past glories. ‘I think (the boardroom change) is positive for the club. For any fan, it’s nice to see people in charge who have the best interests of the club at heart. ‘We all knew it was going to be a difficult period but nobody could have foreseen just how hard it was going to be. ‘But I think Stuart McCall is going to be a good appointment. It was great to see him get that first win on Sunday at Hibs. Hopefully Rangers can build on that and get even stronger. ‘Would I ever go back to Rangers? In football you never know. But it’s a club I look back on fondly and if the opportunity arose it would be something I’d have to consider.’ [Possible prompt] Write a summary about Michael O'Neill, the Northern Ireland manager, expressing hope that both he and Gordon Strachan, the Scotland manager, can lead their respective countries to qualification for the 2016 Euros.", "chosen": "Write a summary about Michael O'Neill and Gordon Strachan, who are set to manage their respective countries in a friendly match.", "rejected": "Write a summary about Michael O’Neill discussing his time working under Gordon Strachan and the current state of Scottish football"}

The Prime Minister said he wanted to 'expand' the marriage tax allowance, which begins next month and is worth £212-a-year for some couples. He said some of his natural supporters had 'drifted' to other parties, as he vowed to stick to his promise to cut net migration to the 'tens of thousands', despite the number soaring to almost 300,000. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron has vowed to expand the marriage tax allowance to win back disgruntled Tory supportersa . Under the Tory policy, 4million married couples are in line for the new tax break designed to support for stay-at-home parents. The £1,060 transferable tax allowance will particularly benefit couples where one parent does not work or only works part-time. However, if both people in a couple earn more than £10,600 they will not qualify and higher rate taxpayers earning more than £42,385 a year are also excluded. The idea was first promised by Mr Cameron when he ran for the Tory leadership in 2005, and marks the first recognition of marriage in the tax system since the married couples' allowance was phased out in 1999. It will apply to spouses who do not use all of their personal allowance – either because they are at home looking after children, or work part-time and earn less than the threshold for income tax, £10,600 in April. They will now be able to transfer up to £1,060 of their unused personal tax-free allowance to a spouse or civil partner, as long as the recipient of the transfer pays the basic rate of income tax, levied on income up to £42,385. That will save the couple up to £212 a year on their tax bill. At the Tory spring forum yesterday, Mr Cameron was heckled by party member Mike Howson who said the PM had 'betrayed this country on Europe and immigration' The Conservative Party will spend an extra GBP8 billion on the NHS if it wins the general election to fund a five year plan drawn up by its chief executive, Jeremy Hunt has promised. The Health Secretary said the Government would fully fund the plan drawn up by NHS England boss Simon Stevens, which would see £2billion being pumped into the health service every year until 2019-20. The so-called 'Stevens plan' will see a total of £30 billion put into the NHS, with £22 billion found through efficiency savings and £8 billion in extra spending. Until now only the Liberal Democrats had pledged to find the money but Mr Hunt has signed the Tories up to the plan. Asked by the Sunday Times if the Tories would find the full £30billion, Mr Hunt said: 'Yes. We've demonstrated that we're as good as our word. 'At the last election we were the only party that promised to protect the NHS budget. We didn't just protect it, we increased it. 'We said to Simon Stevens, 'How much do you need for your plan next year, the first year of your five-year plan?' He said '£1.7billion', and we actually found him £2billion. 'We're now doing the work as to what the efficiency savings are. The gap might be more than £8bn, it might be less. 'That will all be settled in the summer when we do the spending-round discussions. We will continue to spend more in real terms year in, year out.' However, the idea was mocked by Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg who said the state should not lecture people on their private lives. 'We should not take a particular version of the family institution, such as the 1950s model of suit-wearing, bread-winning dad and aproned, home-making mother - and try and preserve it in aspic,' Mr Clegg said in 2011. 'That's why open society liberals and big society conservatives will take a different view on a tax break for marriage.' However, Mr Cameron has signalled that if he is returned to power he wants to increase the amount that married couples could save on their tax bills. He told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I am very proud to have kept my commitment to introduce the married couples' tax allowance. I think it will prove very popular. 'I think it's absolutely right that we recognise marriage in the tax system properly and I would like to see that expanded.' Mr Cameron suggested that it was part of attempts to win back traditional Tory voters who have switched to other parties, including Labour and Ukip. 'I accept I have a task in the next 41 days to win back people who are instinctively Conservative, who have strong Conservative values and some of them have drifted off to other parties. I need to win them back.' At the Tory spring forum yesterday, Mr Cameron was heckled by party member Mike Howson who said the PM had 'betrayed this country on Europe and immigration'. Mr Cameron has come under fire after promising 'no ifs, no buts' to cut net migration to below 100,000. But latest figures released last week show that a total of 298,000 more people arrived in Britain than left in the year to September, as the numbers arriving from the rest of the EU hit a record high. A record 624,000 arrived in Britain in a year, up from 530,000 in the previous 12 months. At the same time, 327,000 left, a figure which has barely changed since 2010. Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending September 2014, a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier . Some senior Tories urged Mr Cameron to ditch the pledge, but he has vowed to repeat it for the general election this year too. He said: 'Britain is facing quite a lot of pressure because the level of migration has been too high for too long.

They will now be able to transfer up to £1,060 of their unused personal tax-free allowance to a spouse or civil partner, as long as the recipient pays the basic rate of income tax, levied on income up to £42,385.

Gigi is close friends with Kendall Jenner (left) and has already managed to bag herself a popstar boyfriend (right) in the shape of Australian singer Cody Simpson . Cody and Gigi showed off their beach bodies whilst enjoying a day out at Miami beach this weekend . Some might say that Gigi's modelling success has been a long time coming, as she first started working when she was just two years old when she was spotted by Paul Marciano of Guess. She took a break so she could study, but picked up her career again after school. At recent fashion weeks, she walked for brands such as Dolce and Gabanna, Sonia Rykiel and Tom Ford - quickly becoming one of the most recognisable faces on the runway. It was also recently announced that the young model is set to be the new face of beauty brand Maybelline. And Gigi's had the praise heaped on her by some of the fashion industries biggest names. Last year Carine Roitfeld, the infamous former editor of Vogue Paris told Style of the model: 'I was drawn to her right away because she was so different, and I love girls that are different—different from me, different from what everyone has seen before. 'I knew immediately that she was going to be a star.' And at the beginning of the year she was named 'Model of The Year,' at the Daily Front Row fashion awards.

Gigi - who has previously landed the cover of Vogue Spain - says she also thinks it's important to connect with her fans and that this is something brands connect with. She said: 'Girls are following me because I’m a model and because they want to see the behind the scenes aspect of it. 'They’re also following because there’s someone, hopefully, that they want to be friends with. And I think there are a lot of models that don’t understand it.' Gigi has become a runway regular, walking for both Dolce and Gabbana (left) and Tom Ford (right) Gigi poses with her fellow models Cara Delevingne  (left) and Kendall Jenner (right) with whom she has become close friends .

The model was quick to take to Twitter to lambast the rumours saying: 'If you actually watch the video there is nothing on the counter .5 seconds before you see that image.' Gigi and Cody attended the Victoria's Secret Pink Ultimate Spring Break Bash this weekend, however, the models fun was marred when she was accused of taking drugs . She continued: 'I would never touch that... it's not only impossible but insane to me. Besides for doing the supposed in general, I'd be an idiot to do that at a WORK EVENT in front of hundreds of people/press. I'm insulted. 'I take pride in being a good role model, would never touch that and will not stand or put up with a little piece of scum blog like YOU.' Ocean's Up is a blog which reported on the video which had been grabbed from Cody's snapchat account which is publicly accessible to his fans.

Leonie Granger, 25, swapped numbers with 56-year-old Mehmet Hassan after meeting him at a casino in Mayfair in London's West End. The father-of-three was found dead a month later after he invited Granger back to his flat in Islington, north London, following a night out, where he was allegedly tied up and beaten. Leonie Granger, 25, (left) has admitted targeting professional gambler Mehmet Hassan (right) in a 'honeytrap' Granger told the Old Bailey the plan was discussed with her boyfriend Kyrron Jackson and his friend Nicholas Chandler, both 28, on the day she met Mr Hassan - February 25 last year. She said: ‘That’s when they first said something about getting someone’s number, get their number and then we’d rob them.’ Asked what words they used, she replied: ‘Honeytrap. Like getting their phone nicked or something, nothing serious. Just go to the casino, get someone’s number, come back out, that was it.’ Her barrister Orlando Pownall QC asked her whether there was any discussion of the consequences to the victim or to herself, which she denied. Later that night Jackson and Chandler dropped her off at the Palm Beach Casino and parked around the corner. She said she was dressed casual in a pair of boots, a dress and a leather jacket when she went inside and met Mr Hassan, who sometimes won as much as £15,000 in one gambling session.

He offered to get me a drink, asked me what I was doing there,’ said Granger. ‘I said I was just looking around the casino, see what it’s like.’ Granger admitted using the name ‘Rachel’ when she gave him her phone number. The next day Mr Hassan texted her: ‘Left just after you, did you get home alright? Mehmet’. Granger, who worked at a care home for elderly people with dementia in Gillingham, Kent, replied: ‘I am working until 7 lol. What you do? Do you live around West End or just socialise?’ Granger exchanged numbers with Mr Hassan and the pair began texting before arranging a night out in March last year - the night before he died . Mr Hassan replied: ‘I live in Islington, I’m a professional poker player. Don’t laugh Rachel because believe me I’m quite good. With your brains and my money we can make you into a great player.’ Granger then said: ‘I would like to become a good player just don’t have the funds to get into it.’ His reply said: ‘Funds is my department Rachel, please it will be my pleasure to wine and dine you.’ Granger told the court that she told Jackson and Chandler she had spoken to someone in the casino but 'that was it'. When asked how much time she had put into the whole project, she told the court that at this stage 'not a lot'. Mr Hassan was allegedly tied up and kicked to death after he took Miss Granger back to his north London flat in the early hours of March 24, last year. He was found lying in a pool of blood in his bedroom after his sister, Abide Ispanedi, raised the alarm at 9pm. A pathologist concluded his death was ‘multi-factorial’ and consistent with kicks to the head, neck and chest.
